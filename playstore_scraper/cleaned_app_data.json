            "description": "Becoming a mother is a wonderful experience, but it can also leave you feeling tired, drained and with an after-pregnancy belly. However, you don't have to let motherhood take over your fitness routine. Here are some postnatal workouts you can do to help you get back in shape and feel confident in your own skin.\r\n\r\nYoga is a great workout option for new mothers. Not only does it help you lose weight, but it also promotes flexibility and stress relief. Start with gentle poses like cat-cow, downward-facing dog, and warrior two. As you progress, you can gradually increase the difficulty of the poses. Yoga is also an excellent way to target the abdominal muscles, helping you tone your after-pregnancy belly.\r\n\r\nPilates is another excellent postnatal workout option that can help you get back in shape. It's low-impact, which means it's gentle on your joints and can help you avoid injury. Pilates can help you build strength, improve posture, and reduce stress. Some popular pilates exercises include the pelvic tilt, the clam, and the bridging. As you get stronger, you can increase the difficulty of the exercises.\r\n\r\nCardio is an important part of any fitness routine, and postnatal workouts are no exception. You can start with gentle activities like walking, swimming, or cycling. As you get stronger, you can increase the intensity of your cardio workouts. Cardio can help you lose weight, improve your cardiovascular health, and boost your energy levels.\r\n\r\nAlong with exercise, diet and hydration play an important role in postnatal weight loss. Aim to eat a balanced diet that includes plenty of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated, and avoid processed foods and sugary drinks.\r\n\r\nBecoming a mother doesn't mean you have to give up your fitness routine. With the right postnatal workouts and a balanced diet, you can get back in shape, lose weight, and feel confident in your own skin. So, whether you prefer yoga, pilates, or cardio, get moving and start feeling like your best self.",

Voice can be your mental guide, a source of motivation, and an aid in making important life decisions.\r\n\r\nYou no longer have to struggle to focus when meditating. Let yourself go and allow your imagination to run wild! You'll get all the effects of meditation without actually having to meditate.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>EASIER THAN MEDITATION. FASTER RESULTS</b>\r\n\r\n- Your past experiences don't matter. Even if you're brand new to this, you'll still see progress in just 8 minutes.\r\n\r\n- You don't need to focus hard on your breathing or be in a certain pose. All you need is to sit down, close your eyes, plug in your earphones, and start listening. We'll take care of the rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>HYPNOTELLING: OUR SECRET WEAPON</b>\r\n\r\nWe like to believe we make all our decisions rationally, but that's not exactly true. Most of the time, we're driven by emotions we don't fully understand or can't entirely control.\r\n\r\nLuckily, your subconscious mind can give you all the things you need. You just need to speak its language - images, sensations etc.\r\n\r\nYour subconscious mind is like a monkey: it doesn't understand words, but it understands visual information, and remembers emotions. Once you understand this, you can tune it to your liking. Voice allows you to connect to your subconscious mind. It teaches, it heals, it helps to calm down and regain your strength.\r\n\r\nFor example, it won't only help you deal with anxiety, sleep problems, or burnout, but will also help get to the root of your problems and the reason behind their symptoms, so you can feel calm, inspired, and motivated again.\r\nYou become the main character of an exciting adventure story. It's sort of like embarking on a psychological quest in a dreamlike state. You move through a story, face challenges along the way, and learn how to tackle them.\r\n\r\nUnlike meditation, our stories help keep your brain alert and conscious. It enters a trance-like state where it absorbs information more effectively, giving you faster results. The closest thing it can be compared to is affirmations. You'll notice relaxation and motivation as quick as 8 minutes story.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>BASED ON RESEARCH-BACKED TECHNIQUES</b>\r\n\r\nHypnotelling is based on a method that has been used for athlete training, supportive therapy, psychotherapy, and for scientific research.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>HYPNOTELLING EFFECTIVELY HELPS</b>\r\n\r\n- lower anxiety and stress levels\r\n- get you to sleep faster without meditation, and improve your sleeping habits\r\n- boost your energy\r\n- increase self-motivation\r\n- improve mental health\r\n\r\nMeditation help you develop mindfulness, but it's a slow and difficult process that can be hard to navigate on your own. Voice is like meditation 2.0: it not only allows you to expand your consciousness, but also helps you apply this experience and take action today, tomorrow, and forever. And the best thing is, you'll acquire beneficial mental skills that will stay with you for the rest of your life!\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>EMBARK ON YOUR ADVENTURE WITH VOICE TODAY</b>\r\n\r\nSend your suggestions and questions to help@voice-stories.app\r\n\r\nUser terms and conditions: https://voice-stories.app/#popup-terms",

Results are displayed for lifetime risk as well as for 10-, 20- and 30-year timeframes, as well as the risk of death from the cancer in question. A subdivision in anatomical or pathological subtypes is provided if possible. Detailed references are provided for the impact of each risk factor.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, over 90 published & validated cancer models have been included in the application, providing more detail for interested users.\r\n\r\nThis application has the CE conformity mark as a medical device with a low risk. As such, we have followed the Class I conformity assessment procedures as described in Annex VII Module A, EC Declaration of Conformity. As it it is considered a medical device that poses minimal risk to patients and consumers, it falls under the FDA exercise enforcement discretions. For more information, please visit the relevant section the official FDA website: https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/mobile-medical-applications/examples-mobile-apps-which-fda-will-exercise-enforcement-discretion\r\n\r\nTo use this application, create an account and enter the requested information in the different tabs as accurately and completely as you can. All information that is requested will influence your risk for at least one type of cancer, so the more complete and accurate the information you enter, the more dependable the results. Age, gender and racial background are critical, all other information is optional. The results will appear after you have completed the last tab and can always be revisited by tapping your name. You can also edit the information you submitted to see how this influences your results.\r\n\r\nThe lifetime probabilities of developing cancers were based on USA data from the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, collected since 1973 and by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR), collected since 1995. These figures were adapted by the hazard ratios available in the published peer-reviewed literature. Only risk factors with a quantifiable risk were included. Risk factors requiring complex tests not available to the average clinician were excluded. Meta-analyses were given preference when available.\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER: This application is strictly educational and all information contained herein cannot and should not replace assessment by a physician. The evaluations presented represent our best efforts to conveniently assess cancer risk. However, as significant controversy and widely different study results can persist around the impact of even a single variable in a strictly selected population, this is based on a large number of assumptions, extrapolations and estimates. As not every study includes a multivariate analysis and the effect of some risk factors on certain cancers is so large their effect cannot be eliminated from basic probability, a bias toward overestimation of risk is possible. Furthermore, there is continuous progress in the scientific literature. Any figures should therefore be regarded as indicative, but not precise.\r\nAny information you enter into this application will only be stored on your device and will never be sent to us or to any other party, for any reason.\r\n\r\nAll research and medical support for this application was done by Dr. Philippe Westerlinck, radiation oncologist and clinical chair at the University Hospital of Li\u00e8ge, superspecialising in gastro-intestinal, lung and breast cancers.",

Taking drugs always involves risks - however, if you do decide to take drugs, KnowDrugs can help you to take appropriate measures to reduce potential harms. \r\n\r\nDRUG INFORMATION & EDUCATION\r\n\r\nCheck the profiles of more than 200 drugs for educational purposes: Stimulants like MDMA and Amphetamine, depressants such as Alcohol and Benzodiazepines or psychedelics like 2C-B, LSD and DMT.\r\n\r\nKnowDrugs provides you with drug education harm reduction advice, focusing on MDMA / Molly / Ecstasy and other psychoactive substances. Knowing about the wanted and unwanted effects of drugs, their duration, interactions and risks helps you to make more informed decisions, reduce risks and reflect upon your drug habits and consumption behaviour.\r\n\r\nDRUG CHECKING, PILL WARNINGS & DRUG ALERTS\r\n\r\nSearch for drug name, substance or location, to find drug alerts from nearby and learn about their ingredients and dosage strength to avoid overdose and particularly dangerous cuts (e.g. PMA).\r\n\r\nDrug checking or pill testing is a way to reduce the harm from drug consumption by allowing users to find out the content and purity of substances that they intend to consume. This empowers users to make safer choices: to avoid more dangerous substances and combination and to use smaller quantities.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have access to professional drug testing services, looking up recent drug testing results can still help you make a more informed decision about your consumption.\r\n\r\nHARM REDUCTION & RESPONSIBLE DRUG USE\r\n\r\nHarm reduction aims to minimize the harms associated with recreational substance use. The harm reduction approach follows from the idea that substance use is a high-risk activity that innately entails the possibility of injury, addiction, and death. Therefore, the best strategy one can employ (outside of avoiding use entirely) is to take appropriate measures to mitigate its potential harms.\r\n\r\nKnowDrugs highlights the harm-potential of more than 200 substances and demonstrates strategies on how to reduce the harms associated with the consumption of drugs.\r\n\r\nKNOWDRUGS CAN ALSO HELP YOU  TO:\r\n\r\n- learn how to spot and react in case of an emergency, take care of someone experiencing a bad trip at a party or festival\r\n- find a free and confidential counselling service which accepts you and your personal choices, and helps you develop the right strategies and competencies if you want to change something about your consumption behaviour.",

            "description": "Genetics is the study of genes and tries to explain what they are and how they work. Genes are how living organisms inherit features or traits from their ancestors; for example, children usually look like their parents because they have inherited their parents' genes. Genetics tries to identify which traits are inherited, and explain how these traits are passed from generation to generation.\r\n\r\nGenes are pieces of DNA that contain information for the synthesis of ribonucleic acids (RNAs) or polypeptides. Genes are inherited as units, with two parents dividing out copies of their genes to their offspring. Humans have two copies of each of their genes, but each egg or sperm cell only gets one of those copies for each gene. An egg and sperm join to form a complete set of genes. The resulting offspring has the same number of genes as their parents, but for any gene, one of their two copies comes from their father, and one from their mother.\r\n\r\n<b>Genetics</b>\r\ngenetics, study of heredity in general and of genes in particular. Genetics forms one of the central pillars of biology and overlaps with many other areas, such as agriculture, medicine, and biotechnology.\r\n\r\nTopics covered in the app are given below:\r\n- Genetics news/blogs\r\n- Genetics cells and DNA\r\n- Health and variants\r\n- How genes work\r\n- Inheriting genetic condition\r\n- Genetics and human traits\r\n- Genetic Consultation\r\n- Genetic Testing\r\n- Direct to consumer genetic testing\r\n- Gene therapy and other medical advance\r\n- Genomic research and precision medicine\r\n\r\nGenetics is termed as the study to understand the functioning of inheritance of traits from parents to offspring. The groundwork on which heredity stands is known as inheritance. It is defined as the procedure by which characteristics are handed down from one generation to the other. Gregor Johann Mendel is known as the \u201cFather of Modern Genetics\u201d for his discoveries on the basic principles of heredity.\r\n\r\nA gene is the basic physical and functional unit of heredity. Genes are made up of DNA. Some genes act as instructions to make molecules called proteins. However, many genes do not code for proteins. In humans, genes vary in size from a few hundred DNA bases to more than 2 million bases. An international research effort called the Human Genome Project, which worked to determine the sequence of the human genome and identify the genes that it contains, estimated that humans have between 20,000 and 25,000 genes.\r\n\r\nIf you like our app then please gave us five star rating.

            "description": "Big scientific encyclopedia of Genetics: genes, genetic variation and heredity in organisms.\r\n\r\nGregor Mendel was the first to study genetics scientifically. Mendel's laws are the principles of transmission of hereditary traits from parents to their descendants. These principles served as the basis for classical genetics and were explained as a consequence of the molecular mechanisms of heredity.\r\n\r\nModern genetics has given rise to a number of subfields: molecular, biochemical, population genetics, epigenetics, genetic engineering etc.\r\n\r\nMolecular genetics revealed the chemical nature of the substance of heredity, showed the physicochemical prerequisites for storing information in the cell and copying it for transmission over a number of generations.\r\n\r\nBiochemical genetics studies the mechanisms of genetic control of biochemical processes in living cells. Thanks to the development of biochemical and molecular genetics, it was possible to identify the cause of various diseases that are not inherited, but associated with dysfunction of genes.\r\n\r\nThe genome contains the biological information needed to build and maintain an organism. The genome is the aggregate of hereditary material enclosed in a living cell. \r\n\r\nBreeding is the science of methods for creating new and improving existing animal breeds, plant varieties and strains of microorganisms. Breeding develops methods of influencing plants and animals in order to change their hereditary qualities in the direction necessary for humans.\r\n\r\nGenetic engineering serves to obtain the desired qualities of a mutable or genetically modified organism. Genetic engineering allows to directly intervene in the genetic apparatus using the technique of molecular cloning.\r\n\r\nDNA replication is the process of creating two identical replicas of DNA molecules based on the parent DNA molecule. Replication process is the most essential part for biological inheritance.\r\n\r\nDNA repair is a special function of cells, which consists in the ability to correct chemical damage and breaks in DNA molecules damaged during normal DNA biosynthesis or as a result of exposure to physical or chemical reagents. A number of hereditary diseases are associated with disorders of the repair systems.\r\n\r\nMeiosis is the division of the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell with a halving of the number of chromosomes. Meiosis occurs in the germ cells in two stages - reduction and equational and is associated with the formation of gametes.\r\n\r\nMitosis is an indirect cell division, the method of reproduction of eukaryotic cells, distributing chromosomes between daughter nuclei, ensuring the formation of genetically identical daughter cells.\r\n\r\nMutation is a permanent change in the genome. The process of occurrence of mutations is called mutagenesis. The main processes leading to the emergence of mutations are DNA replication, impaired DNA repair, transcription and genetic recombination.\r\n\r\nAlleles is a different forms of the same gene, located in the same areas of homologous chromosomes, determine the direction of development of a particular trait.\r\n\r\nGenotype is a set of genes of a given organism. The genotype, in contrast to the concept of the gene pool, characterizes an individual, not a species. Genotype is also understood as a combination of alleles of a gene in a particular organism.\r\n\r\nCloning - the emergence of a natural way or the production of several genetically identical organisms by asexual reproduction.\r\n\r\nThis free offline science dictionary:\r\n\u2022 contains more than 10000 terms;\r\n\u2022 suitable for professionals, amateurs and even beginners;\r\n\u2022 advanced search function with autocomplete - the search will start and predict a word as you enter text;\r\n\u2022 voice search;\r\n\u2022 work offline - the database supplied with the application does not require an Internet connection when searching;\r\n\u2022 includes hundreds of illustrated examples.\r\n\r\nThe Genetics Pocket Dictionary is the best way to keep the information you need close at hand.",

This benefits both the patient and the caregiver.\r\n\r\nThe 'Orthopaedics' app is intended for all healthcare providers involved in the care of patients within orthopedics and related specialties, including sports medicine and physiotherapy. This app contains interpretations of guidelines, including interactive flow charts and handy calculators, which can also be saved as a 'favorite'.\r\n\r\nThe content of this app is checked monthly and updated when a guideline is revised. The app automatically keeps you informed of these new developments. This keeps you always up-to-date.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer:\r\nThe 'Orthopaedics' app should only be used by medical specialists, physician assistants, physiotherapists, interns and medical students. The app offers a clear overview of interpretations of various guidelines in the field of Orthopedics. The app is not intended to be used by patients. Patients are advised to always consult a doctor in case of complaints.",

            "description": "Face IT DNA Technology is a big deal. It uses a similar theory to what's used to unlock your mobile phone or office building using your face. It takes the facial profile of one person, calculates the unique facial points, then compares them to another person to see if those two people could possibly be related.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s an example of how DNA Face Matching and Ancestry Face Matching Works: Our face recognition technology will scan several facial features, for example the alleged father's eyes and compare that calculation to the shape of the potential child\u2019s eyes. You could even compare the facial profiles of one sibling to another sibling. Various algorithms are in place that allow a grandparent, sibling, father, child, aunt, uncle or a cousin to verify relationship. Face Match DNA Technology has the capability to do this with 60+ facial points. For example, the nose, cheeks, ears, head, chin and several other parts of the human face. We use 68 different facial points!\r\n\r\n\u2714 Studies have shown DNA Face Matching to be as high as 92% accurate. \r\n\r\nThe best photos to send are photos looking straight forward into the camera. Sometimes your head can be slightly turned and still pick up the calculations (don\u2019t worry no photo will ever be perfect). The older the person is the more mature their facial features are; therefore, the more recent the photo is the more precise the results usually are. Some people choose to use pictures of relatives at a younger age, even infancy. Yes, baby photos can work as well.\r\n\r\nSimply go to our website or your app store, upload the photos of the two people you\u2019d like to compare facial features on, make your payment and sit back and wait for same-day results. Results are available on our app and via email.

            "description": "The Flow depression treatment is a free personal guide to help you understand, treat & prevent depression and improve your mental health.\r\n\r\nFlow represents a new chapter in the understanding and treatment of depression, based on the latest psychology and neuroscience research.\r\n\r\nThe app can be used on its own and offers a therapy programme with over 50 therapy sessions. The sessions cover a range of topics from behavioural therapy and lifestyle habits, such as, meditation, sleep, diet and exercise. To track changes over time, the app includes the MADRS-s depression test.\r\n\r\nTogether with the Flow brain stimulation headset, the app offers a holistic approach to treating depression. The type of stimulation used in the Flow headset, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), has long been used in clinical settings to treat depression. With Flow, you can now access tDCS in a remote device from your own home. To use the headset you will need the app. \r\n\r\nThe Flow treatment is based on decades of clinical research and is supported by more than 20 randomised double-blind studies. The Flow headset is approved as a medical device (CE) in the EU and UK for the treatment of depression. Order it at: https://flowneuroscience.com\r\n\r\nThe programme contains over 50 sessions split into 7 courses, covering topics such as:\r\n\r\n- Exercise\r\n\r\nPhysical exercise has been shown to have a similar effect to antidepressant medication when it comes to reducing and preventing depressive symptoms. Flow will tell you what type of exercise is beneficial and the optimal \u201cdose\u201d.\r\n\r\n- Meditation\r\n\r\nMeditation is practised by many people around the world as mental \u201cexercise\u201d for the brain. Flow will give you concrete exercises to follow but also show you the neurological basis of why meditation is good for managing stress in your everyday life.\r\n\r\n- Sleep\r\n\r\nDid you know that sleeping for only six hours each night for two nights in a row is equivalent to being continuously awake for 24 hours? Flow will educate you on sleep hygiene, why we sleep and why sleeping is one of four important pillars for overcoming depression.\r\n\r\n- Nutrition\r\n\r\nThe nutrition sessions will advise and encourage you to eat in a way that science has proven reduces inflammation in the brain, thereby alleviating depression. Spoiler alert: sugar is one of the big villains.",

The bat has broken its wing. Do you know what to do? \r\n\r\nWhether a bump on the head, a stomach ache from too much candy, a little wound, or a sunburn, these funny animals need the help of a really good doctor! \r\n\r\nFrom Oscar-nominated artist Heidi Wittlinger, the illustrator and director behind the bestseller Apps \u201eNighty Night\u201c, \u201eLittle Fox Music Box\u201c and \u201eNighty Night Circus\u201c comes a wonderful new 3D-App which your child will love! \r\n\r\nThe app is full of humorous animations, amazing 3D illustrations, and funny short movies.

Together!\r\n\r\nWorry about diabetes less and live life more with Gluroo, a free collaborative diabetes logger that works like a chat app.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe simplest yet most comprehensive diabetes tool you may ever need\u201d \r\n- DiabetesMine\r\n\r\nCOLLABORATE: STREAMLINED FOR DIABETES MANAGEMENT\r\n\r\nWork together to manage the diabetes of your loved one by streamlining group-chat messaging, blood glucose and insulin levels, exercise, device health and more - all in one place for everyone to see.\r\n\r\nStay connected with your GluCrew, whether you\u2019re in the same room or across the globe!\r\n\r\n\r\nLOGGING: COMPREHENSIVE AND EASY!\r\n\r\nWhether with a few simple taps of the intuitive UI or text recognition (\u201ddosed 5u\u201d), Gluroo gives you a fast way to log everything you need:\r\n\r\n* Food\r\n* Insulin doses\r\n* Exercise\r\n* CGM readings and manual finger pricks\r\n* Opening a new insulin vial or pen\r\n* Adding a new pump site, CGM sensor, or transmitter\r\n* Custom hashtags that you can search for later\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTIFICATIONS: SMARTER, FEWER\r\n\r\nAlerts and notifications invade our lives and can be distracting and overwhelming.\r\n\r\nGluroo uses a new method of coordinated smart notifications which makes sure the right set of people get alerted at the right times. Every alert is actionable. For example, if the person with diabetes (PWD) has low blood sugar, Gluroo will alert them first and give them a chance to address the low.\r\n\r\nIf they don\u2019t address it within a few minutes, the alert will roll over to the rest of the GluCrew. This lets the PWD develop responsibility and confidence while always having someone else ready to back them up - and reducing alarm fatigue in the process!\r\n\r\n\r\nSEARCH:\r\n\r\nAs you log meals, doses, exercise and more, you build up a valuable data source. Look back at how you handled a tricky sushi lunch or your favorite pizza joint in the past, expand an inline chart of your blood glucose readings during that period, and use that information to help you handle it better in the future. \r\n\r\n\r\nINTEGRATIONS:\r\n\r\nContinuous Glucose Monitors (CGM) - Dexcom (G7, G6, G5), Freestyle Libre, blood glucose meters, and more planned!\r\n\r\nInsulin Delivery Types - Gluroo supports pumps like Omnipod DASH, Omnipod OP5, DIY Loop, and Nightscout instances with more planned!\r\n\r\nYou can also easily log your daily injections with SmartPens, pens, vials, syringes, and more.\r\n\r\nGluroo is also available for Wear OS (based on G-Watch Wear), and provides a watch face and several Gluroo-specific data complications (the IOB and COB data complications are shown). The data chart on the watch requires the Gluroo phone app to be installed and configured with a supported CGM.\r\n\u2014 More Information \u2014\r\n\r\nCaution: Dosing decisions should not be made based on this device. The user should follow instructions on the continuous glucose monitoring system. This device is not intended to replace self-monitoring practices as advised by a physician.

Family Link\u2019s easy to use tools allow you to understand how your child is spending time on their device, see their device location, manage privacy settings, and more.\r\n\r\n\r\n  With Family Link, you can:\r\n\r\n  <b>Establish Digital Ground Rules</b>\r\n  \u2022 Set screen time limits \u2014 Family Link lets you set downtime for your child\u2019s device and time limits for apps, so you can help them find a healthy balance.\r\n  \u2022 Guide them to age-appropriate content \u2014 Approve or block apps your child wants to download. Family Link also allows you to choose the right YouTube experience for your child: a supervised experience on YouTube, or YouTube Kids.\r\n\r\n  <b>Manage and secure your child\u2019s account</b>\r\n  \u2022 Protect their privacy \u2014 Permissions management in Family Link allow you to make meaningful choices about your child\u2019s data. View and manage permissions for websites and extensions accessed through Chrome as well as apps downloaded on your child\u2019s device.\r\n  \u2022 Secure their account \u2014 Family Link gives you access to manage your child's account and data settings. As a parent, you can help change or reset your child\u2019s password if they forget it, edit their personal information or even delete their account if you feel necessary.\r\n\r\n  <b>Stay connected on the go</b>\r\n  \u2022 See where they are \u2014 It\u2019s helpful to be able to find your family when they\u2019re on the go. With Family Link, you can locate your children on one map, as long as they\u2019re carrying their device.\r\n  \u2022 Get notifications and alerts \u2014 Family Link delivers critical notifications including when your child arrives or leaves a certain location. You can also ring devices and view the device\u2019s remaining battery life.\r\n\r\n\r\n  <b>Important Information</b>\r\n\r\n  \u2022 Family Link\u2019s tools vary depending on your child\u2019s device. See a list of compatible devices at https://families.google/familylink/device-compatibility/\r\n  \u2022 While Family Link helps you manage your child's purchases and downloads from Google Play, they will not need approval to install app updates (including updates that expand permissions), apps you have previously approved, or apps that have been shared in Family Library. In addition, purchase approvals will apply only when your child makes a purchase through Google Play\u2019s billing system and will not apply to purchases made through alternate billing systems. Parents should regularly review their child\u2019s installed apps and app permissions in Family Link.\r\n  \u2022 You should carefully review the apps on your child\u2019s supervised device and disable those you don\u2019t want them to use. Note that you may not be able to disable some pre-installed apps such as Play, Google, etc.\r\n  \u2022 To see the location of your child or teen\u2019s device, the device must be powered on, recently active, and connected to the internet through data or wifi.\r\n  \u2022 Family Link parental controls are only available for supervised Google accounts. With supervised Google Accounts, children get access to Google products like Search, Chrome, and Gmail, and parents can set up basic digital ground rules to supervise them.\r\n  \u2022 While Family Link provides tools to manage your child\u2019s online experience and keep them safer online, it does not make the internet safe. Family Link can not determine the content on the internet, but it can give parents the opportunity to make decisions about how their child spends time on their device, and determine what path to online safety looks best for your family.",

It includes the six regions of the Americas (Andean, Caribbean, Central, North, South, and Tropical) according to tables published in 2019 by the World Health Organization (WHO) (Lancet, 2019). This risk score was based on extensive review of available cohorts and were adapted to 21 global regions based on analysis of the burden of cardiovascular morbidity. For each region, an estimate was published that requires knowing an individual's blood cholesterol level (or other information if the blood cholesterol level is not known). The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), with the financial contribution of the U.S Centers for Diseases Prevention and Control, transformed the published color-coded tables into an online electronic calculator for use on computers and smartphones, updating the previous Cardiocal app (2014)\r\n\r\n\r\nWho is this app for?\r\n\r\nThe calculator is intended to help the health care providers quickly calculate cardiovascular risk and discuss with patients the extent to which their risk can be reduced. It also aims to help people concerned about their health, making it easier for them to estimate the need for a medical consultation when their risk is not low. The treatment recommendations are oriented to the assisting professionals and do not constitute a guide to self-medication, which can be dangerous. Under no circumstances is this calculator intended as a replacement for medical consultation or a clinical judgment.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n\r\n\u00bb Click on the gear icon to choose a country. Each country belongs to one of the six regions mentioned above, and the risk calculation will give different results.\r\n\r\n\u00bb You can change the language (English, Spanish, or Portuguese), cholesterol unit (mmol/L or mg/dl), and metric or imperial units (cm or feet and inches).\r\n\r\n\u00bb The app includes country-specific protocols for the 12 countries whose health ministries have defined standardized protocols for the treatment of hypertension.",

ICMR established AMR surveillance network in 2012 to collect nationally representative data on trends and patterns of AMR to the commonly used antibiotics in pathogens of public health importance. The data emanating from this network has been used to guide the\r\ntreatment of various syndromes.\r\nThe country\u2019s leading infectious disease physicians and clinical microbiologists from leading medical organizations have contributed to this compilation. All recommended therapies are either evidence-based as per universally accepted standards. These are general guidelines; treatment of individual patients may vary depending upon local conditions and experience. The antimicrobial susceptibility data given in this guideline are from selected leading tertiary care hospitals in India and does not represent the\r\ncommunity data. Antimicrobial resistance data is known to differ between different healthcare institutes and between different clinical departments of same institute. Hence each healthcare institute and each clinical department must customize their respective guideline accordingly using ICMR guideline as rational format. ICMR had brought out the first edition of the guideline in 2017. This guideline builds up on the first edition and has additional chapters on skin & soft tissue, bone & joint and CNS infections.",

PSA density was calculated by dividing serum PSA concentration by gland volume. Using a PSA density cutoff of 0.15 as recommended in the literature enhanced specificity but at the cost of missing half of the tumors.\r\n\r\nPSA doubling time (PSADT) has been studied as a survival measure in prostate cancer. PSA doubling time, or the change in PSA level over time, has emerged as a useful predictive marker for assessing disease outcome in prostate cancer. PSA doubling time can be an indicator of biochemical and clinical progression of prostate cancer. This \"Urology PSA Calculator Pro - Prostate Cancer\" app predicts the changes in PSA levels over time.\r\n\r\nThe PSA-age volume (PSA-AV) score was calculated by multiplying the age and prostate volume and then dividing the total by the prebiopsy PSA level. A PSA-AV score less than 700 had a sensitivity and specificity of 95% and 15%, respectively to predict prostate cancer. The PSA-AV score was more sensitive in younger patients and in patients with a small prostate volume.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: all calculations must be re-checked and should not be used alone to guide patient care, nor should they substitute for clinical judgment.

Here is some of the things the team has done based on your feedback.\r\n\r\nNice IPAD Version, great on the iPad mini. Bugs have been fixed in this new version (30). The 02 section for the EC135 tank has been updated to fix them. The ability to change the conversion factor. Added Bell 407 to the list. All over the app, there are new calculators and layouts that you can use. The Peds section added fun a widget that helps you do CPR. In addition, the app's UI has gotten better. This includes the ABG page, the drip (UI changes to the drips show how long it will take to run the next dose), pharmacology (customization), and a lot more. Calcs now have RSBI and BMI added. Smoother animation changes. Of course, there will be speed improvements, major UI changes, small bug fixes, and more!\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease enjoy and let us know how your new Critical experience is!",

            "description": "SMART THINGS COME IN SMALL PACKAGES\r\n\r\nDario makes monitoring blood glucose easy thanks to the small size of its medical device. The Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System combines the meter, lancet and a pack of 25 test strips in a unit so small, it can fit in your pocket. This makes it easy to keep with you, whether at home or on-the-go. With Dario, checking your blood glucose is quick, easy and discreet, one drop at a time. It\u2019s an all-in-one diabetes tracker.\r\n\r\nNOW SUPPORTING BLOOD PRESSURE\r\n\r\nDario is more than just a diabetes tracker for monitoring blood glucose. The app also pairs with the Dario Blood Pressure Monitoring System to record and store blood pressure measurements in the same logbook where you track blood glucose. This gives you a more complete perspective of your health. Track these two medical conditions together to learn more about your health for better conversations with your doctor, and to help you live better every day.\r\n\r\nWHAT MAKES DARIO DIFFERENT?\r\n\r\nDario was designed with convenience in mind, to make it easier to see your medical trends and help build healthy new habits according to your results. With insights gained through the Dario app, you may learn which foods and activities lead to better results. You may see how following a treatment plan improves your blood pressure results. Getting this positive reinforcement in real time can be a powerful motivator! One drop is all it takes to see where you stand with this innovative diabetes tracker.\r\n\r\nKEEP YOUR DOCTOR & LOVED ONES IN THE LOOP\r\n\r\nKeep your medical care providers and family members up to date on your diabetic measurements. You can share all the data and logbooks inside the Dario application with anyone you like. Simply tap the share icon and select a contact from your address book to share your data instantly.\r\n\r\nCOUNT CARBS & TRACK ACTIVITY\r\n\r\nAny diabetic knows how challenging it can be to keep track of carbohydrate intake. Dario does the math for you. Simply tag which foods you ate, and Dario will automatically calculate how many carbs that gave you. With time, you may even start spotting patterns between the foods you\u2019ve eaten and your blood glucose results and learn how to choose foods that your body responds to better. The same goes for activity. With Dario, you can keep track of your daily exercise (even washing the dishes!) and see if it influences your blood glucose levels. The results of this diabetes tracker may surprise you!\r\n\r\nHOW ACCURATE IS DARIO?\r\n\r\nDario has been tested extensively to ensure it meets FDA guidance for accuracy, that 95% of measurements are within \u00b115% of a true lab-tested value. This means you can be assured that the Dario meter will provide results you can trust. Dario has also presented several studies to the ADA, demonstrating how its system can help improve life for people living with diabetes.\r\n\r\nHYPO ALERT SYSTEM WITH GPS LOCATOR\r\n\r\nHypo alerts may save your life! If you have diabetes and have suffered from hypo events in the past, or have a child with diabetes, Dario's hypo alert system with GPS location can help bring you peace of mind. Simply connect the Dario meter to your smartphone, and upon recording a dangerously low glucose reading in one drop of blood, the Dario app will prepare a complete text message, including current blood glucose level and GPS location, to send to up to 4 emergency contacts. Because when a hypo strikes, time is of the essence. And you may not feel well enough to describe your situation. Dario is here to keep you safe.",

Join over 90,000 people with Long Covid, ME/CFS, POTS, Fibro and more who are improving their pacing with Visible.\r\n\r\nPacing means balancing activities and rest to avoid crashes and live better with your condition. It helps you get the most from the energy you have, but it can be challenging to implement in real life. That's where Visible comes in. Unlike fitness tracking apps, Visible uses data and technology to help with rest and pacing, not workouts and exercise.\r\n\r\nMEASURE YOUR PACE\r\nUse your phone\u2019s camera to measure your biometrics, including HRV and Resting Heart Rate each morning, so you can better understand your stability and pace your day.\r\n\r\nTRACK AND SPOT PATTERNS\r\nKeep track of your symptoms, medication, and exertion daily to spot patterns in your illness and see what lifestyle changes are impacting your health.\r\n\r\nHEALTH REPORT AND EXPORT\r\nDownload your monthly and long-term health reports to get an overview of your trends and share them with your doctor.\r\n\r\nTAKE PART IN RESEARCH\r\nOpt-in to studies with world-leading researchers to volunteer your data and help advance the science of invisible illness.\r\n\r\nGET ALL DAY DATA\r\nIf you have a wearable armband, connect it to the Visible app to get real-time pacing notifications, PacePoints, all-day energy budgeting, and more.\r\n\r\nTHOUSANDS OF 5-STAR REVIEWS\r\n\u201cVisible has been LIFE-CHANGING. I had fibromyalgia before COVID and thought I did well at pacing, but this has helped me on a whole new level.\u201d \u2013 Roma\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is the first app in the 33 years since I have been diagnosed with this condition that shows me the data my doctor and I need. Fitness apps don't work well because they are not geared for people with POTS and PEM. This is the very first app that warns me when I have to SLOW DOWN and the monthly reports help my doctors get a better picture of how I'm doing.\u201d \u2013 Lesli\r\n\r\n\u201cI've been using Visible for nearly a year now, and I've finally managed to pace effectively. I used to be in a constant boom & bust cycle with an ever-deteriorating baseline. Since using the armband, I've managed to avoid major crashes. I feel more stable and more in control of my condition. Visible has also helped me to figure out I have POTS, and medication for that has also helped.\u201d \u2013 Rachel\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nVisible is not intended to provide medical services such as diagnosis, cure, mitigation, prevention, or treatment of any disease or medical condition.

Learn the diagnostic process in internal medicine with this engaging, case-based approach. \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\n\"This book is a tremendous asset for students and residents learning to develop their diagnostic skills. It can also be useful as a refresher for established clinicians when the more common diagnoses are not the cause of a patient's complaints.\"\u2015Doody's Review\r\n\r\nAn engaging case-based approach to learning the diagnostic process in internal medicine\r\n\r\nDoody's Core Titles for 2021!\r\n \r\nSymptom to Diagnosis, the latest edition teaches an evidence-based, step-by-step process for evaluating, diagnosing, and treating patients based on their clinical complaints. By applying this process clinicians will be able to recognize specific diseases and prescribe the most effective therapy.\r\n \r\nEach chapter is built around a common patient complaint that illustrates essential concepts and provides insight into the process by which the differential diagnosis is identified.  As the case progresses, clinical reasoning is explained in detail. The differential diagnosis for that particular case is summarized in tables that highlight the clinical clues and important tests for the leading diagnostic hypothesis and alternative diagnostic hypotheses. As the chapter progresses, the pertinent diseases are reviewed. Just as in real life, the case unfolds in a stepwise fashion as tests are performed and diagnoses are confirmed or refuted.\r\n \r\nCompletely updated to reflect the latest research in clinical medicine, this fourth edition is enhanced by algorithms, summary tables, questions that direct evaluation, and an examination of recently developed diagnostic tools and guidelines. Clinical pearls are featured in every chapter. Coverage for each disease includes: Textbook Presentation, Disease Highlights, Evidence-Based Diagnosis, and Treatment.\r\n\r\nChanges include new algorithms and approaches in the chapters on Chest Pain, Syncope, Dizziness, and others. Recently developed new diagnostic tools are discussed in the chapters of Diarrhea, Jaundice, and Cough and Fever, and new guidelines have been included in the chapters on Screening, Diabetes, and Hypertension\r\n\r\nContent licensed from printed edition ISBN 10: 1260121119\r\nContent licensed from printed edition ISBN 13: 978-1260121117\r\n\r\nSUBSCRIPTION :\r\nPlease choose an auto renewable subscription plan to receive content access and continuous updates.

It has been created by Dr. Juan Pablo Burgu\u00e9s, urologist and andrologist with extensive professional experience, to inform you about the health problems that concern men. In Men's App, Dr. Burgu\u00e9s talks about such sensitive topics as impotence, premature ejaculation, sexually transmitted diseases, infertility, testosterone deficiency, benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostate cancer, testicular cancer , etc.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter if you are 18 or 70 years old. Men\u2019s App displays content of interest to all age groups. Obviously, sexually transmitted diseases are of more concern to young men, and prostate cancer to more mature men, but all topics are of general interest. It never hurts to learn!\r\n\r\nTraditionally women have always been aware of the need for gynecological checkups from an early age, but not men! It is true that the risk of uterine cancer for women begins earlier than the risk of prostate cancer for men, so urological reviews are not recommended until the 1940s. But, are men aware of this? Definitely not, men are far from women in this regard.\r\n\r\nThat is why in Men\u2019s App the objective of Dr. Juan Pablo Burgu\u00e9s is to raise awareness and disseminate information about health problems that affect men, in a language that is simple and understandable by anyone. You'll also find some useful tools:\r\n\r\n- Shop for men's products, with items carefully selected for their quality and their guarantee of a safe purchase.\r\n- Get expert opinion.\r\n- Self-assessment test on alcoholism.\r\n- Prostate symptoms questionnaire.\r\n- Track your PSA.\r\n- BMI calculator.\r\n- Stop smoking.\r\n- Safe sex.\r\n\r\nYou can use Men\u2019s App as a tool to understand, learn, prevent or follow recommendations, but if you have a problem, it should never replace the consultation with your doctor.\r\n\r\nThe Men\u2019s App activity consists of short tips on men's health at www.mens-app.es, on social networks (Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin) and in the app. In addition, from time to time Dr. Burgu\u00e9s develops a new in-depth topic that is left for offline reading in the \"Topics\" tab of the app. These are some of the men's health problems that are covered in the Men\u2019s App:\r\n\r\n- Benign prostatic hyperplasia\r\n- Testosterone deficiency\r\n- impotence\r\n- infertility\r\n- Premature ejaculation\r\n- Prostate cancer\r\n- Sexually transmitted diseases\r\n- Testicular cancer\r\n\r\nJoin the Men\u2019s App!

            "description": "Seizure Alert - My Medic Watch is a smartwatch app which interprets data captured by sensor technologies on your smartwatch. By using innovative algorithms, it automatically detects if the wearer has a seizure and activates immediate emergency assistance.\r\n\r\nMy Medic Watch provides monthly and yearly subscriptions which include a 30-day free trial.\r\n\r\nWe do not sell or provide smartwatches, view our compatible smartwatch options at https://www.mymedicwatch.com/smartwatches/\r\n\r\nToday, more and more people are choosing to live independently, in their own homes \u2013 aided by vital technology innovations like Seizure Alert - My Medic Watch, which was validated by Medical trials in Sydney.\r\n\r\nSeizure Alert - My Medic Watch is designed to be downloaded to a wearable device such as a smartwatch. It can be worn by people of all ages who are prone to seizures, and people who are still living alone in their home.\r\n\r\nThis ground-breaking app uses proprietary and innovative algorithms, which interprets data automatically captured by sensor technologies on the smartwatch, to determine if the wearer has a seizure.\r\n\r\nIf the wearer does have a seizure, Seizure Alert - My Medic Watch automatically detects the event and notifies all dedicated caregivers, without the need for manual intervention, providing details of the individual\u2019s location. The app can also be activated manually by the wearer if he or she is feeling unwell and requires assistance, simply by pressing a button on their smartwatch.\r\n\r\nSeizure Alert - My Medic Watch allows people who are vulnerable to seizures to get immediate care and assistance when they have a seizure, so they remain feeling safe in their normal environment and can keep their autonomy.\r\n\r\nThis process has four steps:\r\n\r\n1. Smart Detection: As soon as a seizure occurs, Seizure Alert - My Medic Watch detects it using smartwatch sensors and an accurate algorithm.\r\n\r\n2. Immediate Alert: The app then automatically sends notifications with the wearer\u2019s GPS location to the nominated caregivers without the need for manual intervention based on workflows of escalation.\r\n\r\n3. Reassurance for Everyone: All caregivers are sent updates of the progress, keeping everyone informed and reassured.\r\n\r\n4. Real-Time Data: Included in the user\u2019s subscription is access to real-time data for all related medical episodes. The user can also choose to give access to his or her doctor, so that their medical data can be reviewed securely, online.\r\n\r\nThanks to Seizure Alert - My Medic Watch, those with a condition that makes them susceptible to seizures, can continue to live independently in their own homes, with ultimate peace of mind.\r\n\r\nApp subscription information:\r\n\r\nWith the My Medic Watch app subscriptions, the wearer has his/her smartwatch app running and benefits from being monitored all the time with automatic Seizure detection. These app subscriptions include automatic medical event app notifications to the patient and to the caregivers.\r\n\r\nPlease read below details about this subscription before purchasing it.\r\n\r\n- Payment will be charged to the Google Play Account at confirmation of purchase\r\n\r\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current month\r\n\r\n- Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current month, and identify the cost of the renewal\r\n\r\n- Current subscription may not be cancelled during the active subscription period; however, you can manage your subscription and/or turn off auto-renewal by visiting your Google Play Account Settings after purchase\r\n\r\n- You can refer to My Medic Watch Terms & Conditions ( https://www.mymedicwatch.com/terms-conditions/) and our Privacy Policy (https://www.mymedicwatch.com/privacy-policy/)\r\n\r\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that product, where applicable.",

This app can serve as a valuable communication aid,  by allowing you to generate a straightforward and professional report which can be shared with your physicians.\r\n\r\nIn general, we hope that this App will allow you to: \r\n\r\n1) track epilepsy trends and patterns over time\r\n2) objectively determine effectiveness of your epilepsy treatments \r\n3) improve success of doctors appointments\r\n\r\n\r\nEpilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder which affects 1 in 26 people worldwide.  It can have a relapsing, remitting, and unpredictable course.  Treatment of epilepsy can be frustrating, and has been accurately referred to as being similar to the popular \u201cwhack a mole\u201d game.  Whether your epilepsy is mild or severe, refractory or controlled, it is critical to objectively and consistently monitor certain factors such as number of seizures, seizure triggers, AED drug or ketone levels, and other vital information.    Keeping a detailed epilepsy journal will allow you to quickly notice any changes to your epilepsy, as well as provide you with impartial evidence as to whether your epilepsy treatment is truly effective or losing effectiveness over time.  \r\n\r\nApp Features:\r\n- Easy to use\r\n- Record seizure details (as much or as little as you like)\r\n- Visual representation of data \r\n- Generate reports\r\n- Keep track of medications with reminders\r\n- Customizable to fit your individual epilepsy\r\n- Track from your Wear OS watch\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOur Story/ Mission:\r\n\r\nOur daughter Olivia is our inspiration for this app.  Olivia has a refractory and severe epilepsy which began at age 1. Once Olivia\u00b4s epilepsy started we were advised by our physicians to keep a written epilepsy journal, in order to track trends and treatment response overtime.    Although the journal was helpful in allowing us to objectively monitor the effectiveness of her epilepsy treatments, it was very time consuming and tended to be disorganized; As well, the hundreds of pages of notes did not help us when it became most critical to quickly and accurately summarize months worth of seizure history,  (for example during emergency  hospital  visits or follow up appointments).  During our experience navigating the neurology health care system, we found accurate and effective communication to be a key factor in successfully working with doctors and achieving ideal seizure control.   \r\nWe created this app as a free and simple way to monitor your epilepsy; track trends and patterns, objectively determine effectiveness of seizure treatment overtime, and improve success of doctors appointments.\r\nSince epilepsy contains dozens of ever changing variables, we decided to organize data into simple visuals which demonstrate seizure trends and patterns over a time span of months to years.  \r\nOur epilepsy journal allows you to quickly document all the important variables concerning your epilepsy, and to generate a simple and easy to read report to print out or email your doctors.  \r\nWe hope that this app enables you to grasp a better understanding of your own individual epilepsy, and that it empowers you as an effective communicator and advocate within your epilepsy health care team.",

You can review your answers after the timer runs out and see whether you picked up the normals. You also get to see the diagnoses of the abnormal x-rays. Try to improve on your results to become faster and more accurate.  \r\n\r\nThis game will help with preparation for the FRCR 2B Rapid Reporting Exam but if you need more rapid reporting practice in a platform that simulates the examination, visit the Revise Radiology website.\r\n\r\nTest your physics knowledge with a true false game where you simply read the statement and decide whether it is true or false.\r\n\r\nTry the MCQ (multiple choice questions).

RxGo.com understands that high medication costs can prove to be an extreme financial hardship for many hard-working families across the US.\r\n\r\nOur software allows everyone to compare pricing at nearby pharmacies and print coupons to further lower their costs. Since its inception in 2012 RxGo has saved patients tens of millions of dollars.\r\n\r\nHere are what a few people have said about RxGo:\r\n\r\nI work at a pharmacy and we often have people coming with discount cards from various companies in order to cut the cost of their medicine. We, at the pharmacy, often will take the coupon and compare it with other prices on other coupons for them to make sure we get them the lowest price. Since we\u2019ve started using RxGo as one of the discount programs we check, we\u2019ve all been amazed by how much more money it saves people on most prescriptions. It really does have the lowest price on almost everything we regularly dispense and still for the less common medicine too!\r\n-\tRyan K.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cI wanted to say thank you and yes I have used my card already and have saved $312 just in one month.

During hurricane season it can be useful to listen to ham radio \"hurricane net\" scanners which contain weather conditions and damage reports when hurricanes and tropical storms are approaching or making landfall as well as NOAA weather radio scanners.  Browse the directory to find scanners from far away to hear what citizens in other parts of the country and the world are experiencing.\r\n\r\nInterested in providing scanner radio audio for your area?  If so, you'll need a real scanner radio, a computer, and a cable to get the audio from the scanner to the computer.  Once you have that, program the scanner to monitor what you'd like to make available from your area (police dispatch channels, fire departments, 911 centers, ham radio repeaters, a NOAA weather radio station, air traffic control, etc).  If someone near you is providing a feed that contains both police and fire you could provide a feed that contains only police, only fire, or one that covers only certain districts/precincts.  Next, go to Broadcastify's web site and click on the Broadcast button to sign-up (it's completely free) to provide scanner audio for your area.  As a provider you'll have complete access to the audio archives for all of the scanners they host.\r\n\r\nScanner Radio has been featured in:\r\n\r\n\u2022 The \"Amazing Android Apps for Dummies\" book\r\n\u2022 Android Police's \"7 best police scanner apps\" article\r\n\u2022 Android Authority's \"5 Best Police Scanner Apps for Android\" article\r\n\u2022 The Droid Guy's \"7 Best Police Scanner Apps for Free on Android\" article\r\n\u2022 Make Tech Easier's \"4 of the Best Police Scanner Apps for Android\" article\r\n\r\nThe Scanner Radio app is a perfect companion to the Pulse Point, Mobile Patrol, and Citizen apps as well as weather, hurricane tracker, and breaking news apps.",

            "description": "teamLabBody Pro is a human anatomy app that covers the entire human body, from muscles to bone structures, blood vessels, nerves, and ligaments, as well as internal organs and the brain, based on MRI data on the human body accumulated over more than 10 years by Dr. Kazuomi Sugamoto (supervisor of teamlabbody and former professor of Sponsored Courses at the Graduate School of Medicine and Faculty of Medicine, Osaka University). By providing both overall and detailed views of the human body through organ cross sections (2D) and three-dimensional animation of bones and joints (4D), this app helps users learn seamlessly about the human structure, more intuitively than with traditional publications on human anatomy, kinematics, and medical images.\r\n\r\n\u25a0 Characteristics\r\n3D human model covering the entire body\r\nZoom in and out, seamlessly and instantly, from the human body in its entirety to detailed views of organs such as the peripheral vascular system. View a three-dimensional structure of the human body from any angle, realized by Unity Technologies\u2019 Game Engine.\r\nAn accurate reproduction of the live human body\r\nThis app was created by reproducing the organs in the average human body as a virtual 3D model, based on MRI data accumulated over 10+ years.\r\nThe world\u2019s first three-dimensional visual representation of joint movement in the live human body\r\nThree-dimensional movement  (4D) of joints based on analysis of MRI images shot from multiple positions - revolutionizing the content of existing kinesiology textbooks, written using cadavers.\r\nView cross sections of the human body from any angle\r\nAlthough the sagittal plane, frontal plane, and horizontal plane of the human body can be observed through MRI and CT images, a new function on this app allows users to acquire detailed information about organs at any angle, practical for ultrasound diagnosis.\r\n\u25a0 Main Functions\r\nView the virtual 3D model of the human body in its entirety, or the several thousand body parts individually.\r\nSelect individual parts, such as muscles, bones, nerves, blood vessels, etc.\r\nNavigate through different layers of the human anatomy by using the slide bar function.\r\nSwitch between \u201cShow\u201d, \u201cSemi-Transparent\u201d, and \u201cHide\u201d to choose how to display an organ or category. By choosing to show certain organs with \u201cSemi-Transparent\u201d mode, users can identify where the organs are situated three-dimensionally in the human body. \r\nLook up organs according to their medical names. Users can identify where that organ is situated in the human body through \u201cSemi-Transparent\u201d mode.\r\nSave organs to your Favorites to find them again easily.\r\nCreate up to 100 tags for various body parts to instantly display desired conditions.\r\nNote down important information you want to keep with the Paint function (up to 100 notes).\r\nUse search filters to identify organs, even if you don\u2019t know their names.\r\n\r\n\u25a0 Languages\r\nJapanese, English, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese\r\n\r\n\u25a0 About Dr. Kazuomi Sugamoto\r\nProfessor Kazuomi Sugamoto\u2019s laboratory research team of the Biomaterial Science research center at Osaka University have developed the world's first method of orthopedic disease treatment by analyzing joint movement in three dimensions.\r\nAs a result, this method revealed that voluntary movements of living human beings are different from involuntary movements observed in donor bodies. Noticing the difference the research team, with the aid of 20-30 participants, used CT or MRI scans of all the joints and joint movements in the human body, a process which took over 10 years to complete and analyze.",

Freya will coach you through every single surge with a simple breathing technique and easy visualisation. She will help you relax between surges with a mix of guided meditation, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations. Freya makes it easy for you to keep track of your surges and you can visit the log at any point to see how frequently your surges are coming and how long they are lasting. Freya will also let you know when your labour is established and when it might be a good time to contact your midwife. You will never birth alone with Freya by your side.\r\n\r\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges partly because it sounds nicer but also because \u2018surge\u2019 more accurately describes the sensation you\u2019ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the play store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind - using appropriate terminology - but can be used by all.\r\n\r\nYou can also use Freya in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for your birth. In fact the more you listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective the audio will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. And the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce which helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable.\r\n\r\nYou can also use Freya post-birth any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Parenting can be hard but you\u2019ve got Freya; she\u2019s your friend for life! In fact everything you learn through using Freya - mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, the benefits of taking time out - are skills for life.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place (!) please do let us know at help@thepositivebirthcompany.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT YOU\u2019LL GET:\r\n\r\n\u2022 A timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer)\r\n\u2022 Coaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge\r\n\u2022 A gentle expanding visualisation which you can use to breathe in sync with\r\n\u2022 A detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour\r\n\u2022 Ability to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula\r\n\u2022 Guided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you calm and relaxed, making birth easier, quicker and more straightforward (can also be used in pregnancy and postnatally)\r\n\u2022 Option to share your birth story with a personalised birth announcement\r\n\u2022 Coaching created by renowned hypnobirthing expert Siobhan Miller, founder of The Positive Birth Company\r\n\u2022 You can skip, reorder and even remove tracks from the guided relaxation playlist, so you listen to what you want, when you want. What\u2019s more if things begin to feel a little repetitive you can listen to your own playlist on a third party app (such a Spotify) whilst still using the Freya app to keep track of your surges and coach you through each one.\r\n\u2022 You can switch between the 4-8 breathing pattern and the more manageable 3-6.

This easy-to-use and convenient format will further assist health care professionals in their implementation of the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines\u00ae), thus improving the quality and effectiveness of care provided to patients with cancer.\r\n\r\n\r\nNCCN is a not-for-profit alliance of leading cancer centers devoted to patient care, research, and education. NCCN is dedicated to improving and facilitating quality, effective, equitable, and accessible cancer care so all patients can live better lives. Through the leadership and expertise of clinical professionals at NCCN Member Institutions, NCCN develops resources that present valuable information to the numerous stakeholders in the health care delivery system. By defining and advancing high-quality cancer care, NCCN promotes the importance of continuous quality improvement and recognizes the significance of creating clinical practice guidelines appropriate for use by patients, clinicians, and other health care decision-makers around the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nOver the past 25 years, NCCN has developed an integrated suite of tools to improve the quality of cancer care. The NCCN Guidelines\u00ae document evidence-based, consensus-driven management to ensure that all patients receive preventive, diagnostic, treatment, and supportive services that are most likely to lead to optimal outcomes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe NCCN Guidelines are a comprehensive set of guidelines detailing the sequential management decisions and interventions that apply to 97 percent of cancer cases in the United States. In addition, separate guidelines relate to major prevention and screening topics and another set of pathways focuses on the major supportive care areas.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe NCCN Guidelines provide recommendations based on the best evidence available at the time they are derived. Because new data are published continuously, it is essential that the NCCN Guidelines also be continuously updated and revised to reflect new data and new clinical information. The intent of the NCCN Guidelines is to assist in the decision-making process of individuals involved in cancer care\u2014including physicians, nurses, pharmacists, payers, patients and their families\u2014with the ultimate goal of improving patient care and outcomes. The NCCN Guidelines provide recommendations for appropriate care for most but not all patients; however, individual patient circumstances must be considered when applying these recommendations.\r\n\r\n\r\nVisit NCCN.org to learn more about the NCCN Guidelines as well as other NCCN Content.",

Here, you can establish your own mental hospital, rehabilitate patients, and earn money with an idle touch.\r\n\r\nAs typical in tycoon games, you begin small: a few wards and some patients. Your mission is to create a healing environment: tend to your patients, feed them, provide clean clothes and showers, and ensure they get enough sleep. It's a breeze with this game's straightforward controls and idle elements. Assist in healing and discharging your patients. The more patients you cure, the more money you make. Remember, your primary goal is not only to help but also to become wealthy.\r\n\r\nRun a hospital like a tycoon with an idle aspect: employ cooks, cleaners, orderlies, and doctors. Monitor patients' calm levels and prevent mass riots; otherwise, your orderlies will have to chase patients to stop them from escaping in this idle adventure!\r\n\r\nPatients will keep coming, so swiftly build and expand your hospital. Add new wards and rooms to accommodate more patients and earn money. Unlock new locations for constructing hospitals - in the forest, on an island, in the mountains, or even at an orbital station. Expand your business like in tycoon games and help people like in hospital games simultaneously, all while enjoying the idle components. \r\nBecome the wealthiest manager in this Idle-tastic Mental Hospital Tycoon!",

Document each flare-up using pictures and scales as soon as they appear. Over time, valuable insights and patterns can be derived from the eczema diary that help to identify your specific triggers.\r\n\r\n- Get direct eczema help: You can contact eczema experts directly via Nia. Our doctors will give you specific recommendations based on your input. This makes holistic assessments easier.

This app will help you come up with a home workout schedule for women from Monday through Sunday each week for 30 days long.

HeartScan app uses your smartphone's embedded accelerometer and gyroscope to record your SCG. After the recording, the app uses advanced mathematical algorithms to analyze your SCG and extract information about your heart.\r\n\r\nUsing the app is fast and easy. Simply lay flat on your back, otherwise known as the supine position, start the app, and place the phone on your chest. Wait 1 minute for the data to be collected and check the results right there onscreen.\r\n\r\nWhat does the app measure and present?\r\n\r\n\u2022 An SCG chart with all recorded cardiac cycles. A cardiac cycle is a full process from the beginning of one heartbeat to the beginning of the next. The length of time between successful heartbeats can vary by up to 20%, but if the differences are longer or erratic, you may need to investigate this further.\r\n\u2022 Heart rate. You can use the HeartScan app as a resting heart rate monitor, and get a very accurate measure of the heart rate.

This app will also verify certificates for COVID test outcomes and recovery by some countries.\r\n\r\nVCV users can verify these certificate by scanning a QR code displayed on:-\r\n(1) the MySejahtera application, or its equivalent as used in another country, \r\n(2) an electronic version of the certifcate ie on PDF form, or\r\n(3) a printed paper version of the certifcate.\r\n\r\nVCV verifies two categories of certificate QR codes containing:-\r\n(1) URL of a trusted server that points to identity and vaccination information. This verification requires internet connectivity.\r\n(2) Identity and vaccination information with a digital signature issued by a trusted entity. For this verification, internet connectivity is not required because the list of trusted public keys is stored in VCV.\r\n\r\nVCV will be updated periodically to maintain the list of trusted servers and trusted public keys.\r\n\r\nVCV will display the result of vaccination certificate verification. Identity and vaccination information is displayed only if the vaccination certificate is valid. VCV is designed to not retain certificate information, as a privacy protective measure.\r\n\r\nThe present version of this application is able to verify certificates from the following countries:-\r\n- Malaysia\r\n- All countries that have been accepted into the European Union (EU) Digital COVID Certificate (DCC) consortium.

You can sync to Coros (activity data only), Diabetes:M, Fitbit, Google Fit, Health Connect, Samsung Health, Schrittmeister, FatSecret (weight only), Runalyze, Smashrun, Strava, Suunto (activity data only) or the MapMy apps (MapMyFitness, MapMyRun etc.). Activity data can also be synced as FIT, TCX or GPX file to Google Drive. Health Sync works automatically and syncs the data in the background. \r\n\r\nIt will sync data from the time you first use the app. Historical data (all data before the day of installation) can be synced after the free trail period. You can't sync historical data from Polar (Polar doesn't allow this). \r\n\r\n<b>Caution: Huawei has announced that apps like Health Sync will be restricted from accessing GPS information from Huawei Health if connected after July 31, 2023. However, as of now, this rule is not being enforced, so your activity GPS data will likely continue to sync.</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Samsung decided in 2020 that no partner app can write steps to Samsung Health anymore. Reading steps data and other data, and writing other data works normally.</b>\r\n\r\n<b>One week free trial</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Health Sync is very easy to use. It offers you a one week free trial period. After the trial period, you can make a one-time purchase or start a six-month subscription to continue using Health Sync. For the Withings sync an additional subscription is required. The additional subscription is required due to recurring additional costs that we incur for this integration.</b>\r\n\r\nJust try the app and see if it fits your needs. What data you can sync depends on the source app from which you sync data, and the destination app(s) to which you sync the data. \r\n\r\nYou can choose different source apps for different types of data. For example: sync activities from Garmin to Samsung Health, and sync sleep from Fitbit to Samsung Health and Google Fit. After the first initialization actions, you can define the different sync directions.\r\n\r\nHealth Sync can sync your Garmin Connect data to other apps, but it cannot sync data from other apps into the Garmin Connect app. Garmin does not allow this. For more information and available workarounds for syncing activity data or weight data to Garmin Connect, please visit the Health Sync website check the FAQ for information about the sync to Garmin Connect.\r\n\r\nSyncing between health data apps sometimes doesn't work as expected. Don't worry, almost all issues can be solved easily. You can check the Help Center menu in Health Sync. And if you can't solve the issue, you can send a Health Sync problem report (the last option in the Help Center menu), or send an email to info@appyhapps.nl  You will get support to solve the sync issue.",

To answer this question, two urologists, Drs. Price Kerfoot and Paul Turek, surveyed hundreds of residency directors from different medical disciplines as well as graduating medical students, and analyzed and published what these stakeholders felt all students needed to know about Urology. Based on this research, an essential curriculum for all medical students was developed by the AUA and is now available to all students. Through this innovative, standardized curriculum, it is the hope of this society that all students will learn the core principles and practices in urology that are important for every practicing physician to know and apply throughout their medical careers, regardless of their career path.",

CHPW Virtual Care connects you with a doctor anytime, day or night, without having to leave your home.\r\n\r\nDesigned especially for Community Health Plan of Washington (CHPW) members, our app gives you convenient access to health care by phone or video whenever you need it. Don\u2019t feel like driving to the doctor or sitting forever in waiting rooms? We\u2019ve got you covered.\r\n\r\nHOW IT WORKS\r\n\r\nRequest an appointment 24/7. Just open the CHPW Virtual Care App, request a virtual consult, provide medical history, and pay for the consult (your CHPW insurance covers telehealth visits). You can request a virtual visit for a scheduled time, or \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d A board-certified doctor from Teladoc will then review your medical history and contact you via phone or video. The length of the session depends on your medical issue. There is no time limit for consults.\r\n\r\nWHAT DOES IT COST?\r\n\r\nThe CHPW Virtual Care service is included in your CHPW plan benefit. Regular copays may apply for virtual visits with a Teladoc doctor if your plan has a copay. Check your plan\u2019s Evidence of Coverage for details.\r\n\r\nWHAT CAN CHPW VIRTUAL CARE HELP YOU WITH?\r\n\r\nCHPW Virtual Care connects you with a board-certified Teladoc doctor who is licensed to practice in Washington State. The doctor can diagnose, treat, and prescribe medicine for a wide range of illnesses and conditions including:\r\n \r\n   \u2022\tAllergies\r\n   \u2022\tCough/Cold\r\n   \u2022\tFlu\r\n   \u2022\tBladder Infections\r\n   \u2022\tHeadache\r\n   \u2022\tNausea\r\n   \u2022\tPink eye\r\n   \u2022\tEar infection\r\n   \u2022\tRash\r\n   \u2022\tSinus problems\r\n   \u2022\tStomachache\r\n   \u2022\tSore throat\r\n \r\nTeladoc doctors cannot make referrals to specialists or other providers. If you need to follow up after the virtual consult, contact your primary care provider.\r\n\r\nWHAT ABOUT PRESCRIPTIONS?\r\n\r\nThe doctor can prescribe medications if he or she thinks it\u2019s necessary to treat your condition. Prescriptions are sent electronically or by phone to the pharmacy of your choice. The medicines can also be delivered to you by mail if the pharmacy you choose provides mail-order service for CHPW members.\r\n\r\nWHEN SHOULD I USE CHPW VIRTUAL CARE?\r\n\r\nFirst, you should see a doctor via CHPW Virtual Care only for non-emergency illnesses.

For the game to be successful, both eyes must work together and your child should play with 3D glasses. This is a proven method for developing missing connections to the amblyopic eye, which leads to the development of binocular vision.\r\n\r\nDuring such training, the eyes work really intensively. That's why we created games that are suitable and interesting for the youngest children, to encourage them to play.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Games are simple and intuitive, suitable for children from 3 years of age. Smaller children can play for just a few minutes to not get discouraged because it is a really intense training.\r\n- The main characters of the games are animals that every child likes!\r\n- Standard red and blue 3D glasses are sufficient to successfully use the therapy. \r\n\r\nThis application can be used by :\r\n- children with no visual problem\r\n- children with functional amblyopia, resulting from strong difference in visual acuity between the two eyes (anisometropia)\r\n\r\nThis application is not a medical device. We recommend to consult periodically with an eye doctor and a vision therapist.\r\n\r\nMore information can be found on layzeyeproject.com",

            "description": "Looking to see our app in action? Kathlyn Celeste recently used Christian Hypnobirthing to prepare for her beautiful home water birth! YouTube.com/KathlynCeleste\r\n\r\n\"With God all things are possible\"\r\n(and that includes an amazing birth!)\r\n- Matthew 19:26\r\n\r\nUsing Christian Hypnobirthing, thousands of women around the world have experienced easier, more relaxed births - some even completely pain-free without any medicated pain relief! This is because the scripture-based audio tracks help condition your mind and body to trust in God, and come into a relaxed, faith-filled state. Being in this state helps the body produce oxytocin (the hormone responsible for an efficient labour) and endorphins (your body's natural pain relief).\r\n\r\nThe relaxation techniques used in Christian Hypnobirthing can be applied no matter what kind of birth you're having, whether that's an unmedicated physiological birth, a cesarean, or anything in between... If you believe that God is with you throughout your pregnancy, and that birth is a positive and wonderful opportunity to connect with Him and your baby, then that will have a massive impact on your birth experience.\r\n\r\nCHRISTIAN HYPNOBIRTHING CAN:\r\n\r\n- help you feel more connected to God and your baby during pregnancy and birth\r\n- increase comfort naturally during birth\r\n- decrease stress and fear\r\n- provide comfort and relaxation throughout pregnancy\r\n\r\nCAN HYPNOBIRTHING BE CHRISTIAN?\r\n\r\nYes!\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of misconceptions around what hypnobirthing is (some people worry that it\u2019s a form of mind control or \u2018not right with God\u2019 etc - which could not be further from the truth).\r\n\r\nSimply put, hypnobirthing brings you into a deeply relaxed state, where you\u2019re able to absorb positive affirmations and beliefs about birth while remaining alert and completely in control. In fact, as a Christian, you\u2019ve probably already experienced being in this relaxed state many times, during prayer or worship activities, etc.\r\n\r\nListening to Christian Hypnobirthing helps to bring you into this calm, faith-filled state, which can help make birth a more relaxing and joyful experience.\r\n\r\nTHE APP FEATURES:\r\n\r\nOver an hour of audio tracks including:\r\n- Breathing and Visualisation exercises\r\n- Encouraging Scriptures for birth\r\n- Positive Affirmations\r\n- Prayers for strength\r\n- Postpartum encouragement\r\n\r\nA \u2018Positive Birth\u2019 section with links to birth videos, and more.\r\n\r\nBlog and Birth Stories\r\n\r\nA 50% discount code for our Printable Birth Affirmation Cards.\r\n\r\nDownload Christian Hypnobirthing and benefit from both the relaxing and calming effects of hypnobirthing, combined with the huge strength, love and support that come from our Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, and Holy Spirit.\r\n\r\nPlease note Christian Hypnobirthing is designed to help support you in a more comfortable birth, but it is in no way a substitute for the advice or presence of a qualified obstetrician, midwife or other medical caregiver. Please always consult your doctor before making any changes to your pregnancy, birth or lifestyle choices.\r\n\r\nwww.christianhypnobirthing.com\r\n\r\nRead more about our terms and conditions here:\r\nTerms of service: https://www.websitepolicies.com/policies/view/JAXVq4Ry\r\nPrivacy policy: https://www.websitepolicies.com/policies/view/2wZXCrdl",
