The RxSaver app offers instant rx coupons on demand. \r\n\r\nDoes RxSaver Work For Rx Pet Meds?\r\nIf your pet needs prescription drugs, you don\u2019t have to pay full-price! RxSaver offers free coupons for pet meds that have human equivalents, which can be easily filled at local pharmacies. Ask your vet before filling your pet's next prescription.\r\n\r\nPlease visit https://www.goodrx.com/consumer-health-data-privacy-notice to read our Consumer Health Data Privacy Notice for additional information about our handling of consumer health data.",
