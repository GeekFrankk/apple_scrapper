Order from EyeQue or Amazon today!*\r\n\r\nOur second-generation CES-award winning vision test, VisionCheck, is powered by MIT-patented technology to help you learn about your refractive error i.e. your nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism.\r\n\r\nYou can use the EyeQue VisionCheck app if you:\r\n\r\n- Have a single vision prescription between +8.00 and -10.00\r\n\r\n- Have a cylinder between 0 and -5.00\r\n\r\n- Are ages 25 and older\r\n\r\n- Want to track your vision\r\n\r\nYou should not use the EyeQue VisionCheck app if you:\r\n\r\n- Have light sensitivity\r\n\r\n- Are colorblind or have difficulty differentiating between red and green\r\n\r\n- Require a prism measurement\r\n\r\n- Have difficulty holding up a smartphone while navigating the smartphone screen\r\n\r\n- Have a medical condition that affects your eyes or eyesight, including but not limited to glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, or cataracts. \r\n\r\nThe VisionCheck uses MIT-patented Inverse Shack-Hartmann technology, which utilizes optical lenses combined with your smartphone\u2019s pixel movement, to measure where the light focuses on the back of your retina. This means that to take a vision test, you\u2019ll attach the VisionCheck to your phone, which will act a light source during the test, then take multiple measurements at different angles by merging a red and a green line into a solid yellow line.\r\n\r\n*This is a self-administered vision test and results may vary. Our test performance feedback instantly lets you know how well you tested and provides resources to improve test performance.*\r\n\r\nWe take your privacy very seriously and do not share your information with 3rd parties.",
