    "description": "THE DOCTOR WILL SEE YOU NOW. CHPW Virtual Care connects you with a doctor anytime, day or night, without having to leave your home.\r\n\r\nDesigned especially for Community Health Plan of Washington (CHPW) members, our app gives you convenient access to health care by phone or video whenever you need it. Don\u2019t feel like driving to the doctor or sitting forever in waiting rooms? We\u2019ve got you covered.\r\n\r\nHOW IT WORKS\r\n\r\nRequest an appointment 24/7. Just open the CHPW Virtual Care App, request a virtual consult, provide medical history, and pay for the consult (your CHPW insurance covers telehealth visits). You can request a virtual visit for a scheduled time, or \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d A board-certified doctor from Teladoc will then review your medical history and contact you via phone or video. The length of the session depends on your medical issue. There is no time limit for consults.\r\n\r\nWHAT DOES IT COST?\r\n\r\nThe CHPW Virtual Care service is included in your CHPW plan benefit. Regular copays may apply for virtual visits with a Teladoc doctor if your plan has a copay. Check your plan\u2019s Evidence of Coverage for details.\r\n\r\nWHAT CAN CHPW VIRTUAL CARE HELP YOU WITH?\r\n\r\nCHPW Virtual Care connects you with a board-certified Teladoc doctor who is licensed to practice in Washington State. The doctor can diagnose, treat, and prescribe medicine for a wide range of illnesses and conditions including:\r\n \r\n   \u2022\tAllergies\r\n   \u2022\tCough/Cold\r\n   \u2022\tFlu\r\n   \u2022\tBladder Infections\r\n   \u2022\tHeadache\r\n   \u2022\tNausea\r\n   \u2022\tPink eye\r\n   \u2022\tEar infection\r\n   \u2022\tRash\r\n   \u2022\tSinus problems\r\n   \u2022\tStomachache\r\n   \u2022\tSore throat\r\n \r\nTeladoc doctors cannot make referrals to specialists or other providers. If you need to follow up after the virtual consult, contact your primary care provider.\r\n\r\nWHAT ABOUT PRESCRIPTIONS?\r\n\r\nThe doctor can prescribe medications if he or she thinks it\u2019s necessary to treat your condition. Prescriptions are sent electronically or by phone to the pharmacy of your choice. The medicines can also be delivered to you by mail if the pharmacy you choose provides mail-order service for CHPW members.\r\n\r\nWHEN SHOULD I USE CHPW VIRTUAL CARE?\r\n\r\nFirst, you should see a doctor via CHPW Virtual Care only for non-emergency illnesses.  And as always, if you have a medical emergency, call 911. With that in mind here are a few good reasons to use CHPW Virtual Care:\r\n\r\n1.\tYou\u2019re not feeling well and your doctor or clinic isn\u2019t available.\r\n2.\tIt\u2019s difficult or inconvenient to travel to the doctor\u2019s office.\r\n3.\tIt\u2019s after hours or on the weekend.\r\n4.\tYou want to avoid the hassle, wait time, and/or high cost of going to Urgent Care or ER.\r\n\r\nHOW DO I GET CHPW VIRTUAL CARE?\r\n\r\nYou must be a Community Health Plan of Washington plan member to access the telehealth service. Visit chpw.org for more information on Medicaid (Apple Health) plans or medicare.chpw.org for information on Medicare plans. Or call CHPW at 1-800 440-1561 (TTY: Dial 711).",
