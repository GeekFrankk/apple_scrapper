Our app analyzes direct-to-consumer genetic tests and presents the findings in a simple way.\r\n\r\n\r\nHave you taken a DNA test? Did you know your genome has a lot to say? Want to learn more about your DNA? It is easier than you think.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you had your DNA tested by a DTC genetic testing provider such as 23andMe, AncestryDNA, FamilyTreeDNA (FTDNA), MyHeritage, Genes for Good, Living DNA, or Geno 2.0, you will have access to a file containing your genetic data (raw data file). When you process this file with Genomapp, our app matches the DNA you entered to a categorized list of conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n*** Ready to start?\r\n\r\nGenomapp has a Demo mode. If you want to try the app or learn how it works you can access it and test a fully functional version of the app.\r\n\r\n\r\n*** What does Genomapp offer?  \r\n\r\nGenomapp offers 3 reports for free and 3 reports will be provided after payment.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Complex Diseases (Markers associated to multifactorial conditions that are the result of multiple genetic and environmental factors interacting.)\r\n\r\n\r\n* Inherited Conditions (Markers related to diseases that are caused by mutations in one gene)\r\n\r\n\r\n* Pharmacological response (Drug-Marker associations)\r\n\r\n\r\n* Traits (Characteristics or attributes expressed by genes and/or influenced by the environment)\r\n\r\n\r\n* Observable signs (Markers related to physical problems or signs that a person experiences)\r\n\r\n\r\n* Blood Groups (Markers related to antigenic diversity of human blood group systems)\r\n\r\n\r\n*** Not Diagnostic\r\n\r\nPlease note that Genomapp is NOT for diagnostic use, it does not provide medical advice and is not a substitute for it.
