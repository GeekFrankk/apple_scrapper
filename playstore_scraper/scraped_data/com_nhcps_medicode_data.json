    "description": "Tired of carrying a set of expandable CPR cards all the time for algorithms? Flipping through the cards to find the right one wastes valuable time in emergency health care situations such as cardiac arrest and pediatric urgent care. MediCode gives you easy access to all of the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) algorithms from the palm of your hand and includes multiple-choice practice tests for you to test your skills. \r\n\r\nThis Algorithms, Practice Tests, Megacodes and ebooks app makes it easy for physicians, paramedics and nurses to care and save lives. Download this health care professional\u2019s app for free.\r\n\r\nAs health care professionals - critical care physicians, nurses, medical students, paramedics, and Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT), you save lives every day.
