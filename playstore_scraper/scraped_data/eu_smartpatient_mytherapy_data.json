You can track these metrics directly in the MyTherapy treatment tracker to see how your weight, blood pressure, etc. develop over time. Together with the pain diary and mood tracker, this forms a good basis for discussions with your doctor and pharmacist regarding any medical condition, ranging from migraines to ADHD.\r\n\r\n<b>Download our pill reminder now! </b>\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udca1 <b>Easy to set up: </b> Simply type in your medication or search our drug database to set your medicine reminder to any time or cycle you need and even set different times for the weekend.\r\n\r\n\u23f0 <b>Medication reminder: </b> A reliable \u2013 perhaps even (positively) annoying \u2013 pill reminder for taking your medication, tablets, and pills on time.
