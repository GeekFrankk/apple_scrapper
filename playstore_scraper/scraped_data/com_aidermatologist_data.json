Whether it's identifying rashes, nevus or cancer, checking moles, analyzing your skin's condition, or scanning for acne. AI-Dermatologist combines all these functions and recognizes 58 different skin conditions in one convenient application. By incorporating today's most advanced Artificial Intelligence technologies and drawing from the expertise of dermatology professionals, our app empowers you to assess the risk of various skin issues, such as spots, birthmarks, acne, moles, or papillomas.\r\n\r\nIn just one minute, AI-Dermatologist provides you with valuable insights and recommends the appropriate next steps to take if any concerns arise. Furthermore, the app enables you to store photos, allowing you to monitor changes over time and track your skin's health in the long run. By creating an AI-Dermatologist, we aim to make skin screening and monitoring accessible to everyone.\r\n\r\nWith AI-Dermatologist, you can enjoy the following features:\r\n- Capture snapshots of skin spots, birthmarks, moles, and other skin conditions, including angiomas, warts, papillomas, mollusks, and more.\r\n- Take or upload photos to track and observe changes over time.\r\n- Easily log the tracked your skin conditions locations on your body for better record-keeping.\r\n- Receive timely reminders for taking new photos and tracking progress.\r\n- Monitor the dynamics of baseline and follow-up results for a comprehensive view of your skin health.\r\n\r\nIt is essential to understand that an AI-Dermatologist is not a diagnostic tool and cannot replace or substitute a visit to your doctor. Our application aims to raise awareness of your skin condition through self-examination, but it should not be considered an online dermatology platform. If you ever notice any discomfort or changes in your skin spot, such as irritation, itchiness, or bleeding, we strongly advise reaching out to a medical specialist promptly. Early consultation with a healthcare professional can help avoid potential risks associated with melanoma or other skin diseases.\r\n\r\nDownload AI-Dermatologist today and take charge of your skin's well-being with the power of AI and professional dermatological expertise at your fingertips.
