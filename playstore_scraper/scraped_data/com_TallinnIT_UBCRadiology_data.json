The app content is organized into the pre-clinical (MS1, MS2) and clinical (MS3, MS4, intern) years. The focus of the pre-clinical years is on identifying normal anatomy and acquiring basic ultrasound skills and the focus of the clinical years is to become familiar with ordering appropriateness criteria and to recognize key pathology. The list of clinical cases presented in this app are developed from the UBC third year medical student clerkship \u201cMust See\u201d clinical objectives. \r\n\r\nWe encourage you to work through this app as a curriculum to enhance your understanding of radiology.",
