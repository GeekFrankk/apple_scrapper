YouTube.com/KathlynCeleste\r\n\r\n\"With God all things are possible\"\r\n(and that includes an amazing birth!)\r\n- Matthew 19:26\r\n\r\nUsing Christian Hypnobirthing, thousands of women around the world have experienced easier, more relaxed births - some even completely pain-free without any medicated pain relief! This is because the scripture-based audio tracks help condition your mind and body to trust in God, and come into a relaxed, faith-filled state. Being in this state helps the body produce oxytocin (the hormone responsible for an efficient labour) and endorphins (your body's natural pain relief).\r\n\r\nThe relaxation techniques used in Christian Hypnobirthing can be applied no matter what kind of birth you're having, whether that's an unmedicated physiological birth, a cesarean, or anything in between... If you believe that God is with you throughout your pregnancy, and that birth is a positive and wonderful opportunity to connect with Him and your baby, then that will have a massive impact on your birth experience.\r\n\r\nCHRISTIAN HYPNOBIRTHING CAN:\r\n\r\n- help you feel more connected to God and your baby during pregnancy and birth\r\n- increase comfort naturally during birth\r\n- decrease stress and fear\r\n- provide comfort and relaxation throughout pregnancy\r\n\r\nCAN HYPNOBIRTHING BE CHRISTIAN?\r\n\r\nYes!\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of misconceptions around what hypnobirthing is (some people worry that it\u2019s a form of mind control or \u2018not right with God\u2019 etc - which could not be further from the truth).\r\n\r\nSimply put, hypnobirthing brings you into a deeply relaxed state, where you\u2019re able to absorb positive affirmations and beliefs about birth while remaining alert and completely in control. In fact, as a Christian, you\u2019ve probably already experienced being in this relaxed state many times, during prayer or worship activities, etc.\r\n\r\nListening to Christian Hypnobirthing helps to bring you into this calm, faith-filled state, which can help make birth a more relaxing and joyful experience.\r\n\r\nTHE APP FEATURES:\r\n\r\nOver an hour of audio tracks including:\r\n- Breathing and Visualisation exercises\r\n- Encouraging Scriptures for birth\r\n- Positive Affirmations\r\n- Prayers for strength\r\n- Postpartum encouragement\r\n\r\nA \u2018Positive Birth\u2019 section with links to birth videos, and more.\r\n\r\nBlog and Birth Stories\r\n\r\nA 50% discount code for our Printable Birth Affirmation Cards.\r\n\r\nDownload Christian Hypnobirthing and benefit from both the relaxing and calming effects of hypnobirthing, combined with the huge strength, love and support that come from our Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, and Holy Spirit.\r\n\r\nPlease note Christian Hypnobirthing is designed to help support you in a more comfortable birth, but it is in no way a substitute for the advice or presence of a qualified obstetrician, midwife or other medical caregiver.
