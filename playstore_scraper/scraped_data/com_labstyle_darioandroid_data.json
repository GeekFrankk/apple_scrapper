If you have diabetes and have suffered from hypo events in the past, or have a child with diabetes, Dario's hypo alert system with GPS location can help bring you peace of mind. Simply connect the Dario meter to your smartphone, and upon recording a dangerously low glucose reading in one drop of blood, the Dario app will prepare a complete text message, including current blood glucose level and GPS location, to send to up to 4 emergency contacts. Because when a hypo strikes, time is of the essence. And you may not feel well enough to describe your situation. Dario is here to keep you safe.",
