On this epic inner journey, you\u2019ll reconnect with your wisest self and unlock a whole range of psychological powers:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Improve your emotional intelligence, self care and coping skills\r\n\u2022 Calm your nerves and soothe overwhelming feelings\r\n\u2022 Uncover new paths to self improvement, self actualization and growth\r\n\u2022 Tap into your subconscious mind through the power of story\r\n\u2022 Identify your values to increase your motivation, sense of gratitude and life purpose  \r\n\u2022 Deepen your self knowledge to help you in overcoming sadness, resentment, low self esteem, fixed mindset, negative perception, insecurities.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udca1 <b>WHAT MAKES BETWIXT WORK</b>\r\nBetwixt is a relaxing, de-stressing game that draws on decades of psychology research and therapeutic practice into how we feel, think and behave. It includes tools for emotion regulation and self reflection, journal prompts for mental health, elements of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), mindfulness approaches, Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT), Jungian theory and others. Together, these methods work to improve your wellbeing, calm your mind, increase your self esteem and help you deal with challenging emotions. \r\n\r\n\u25c6 <b>An immersive experience</b>\r\nIn Betwixt, you become the hero (or heroine) of an interactive adventure through a dreamlike world that responds to your thoughts and feelings. We\u2019ve used immersive storytelling and sounds to create an alternative for people who find a CBT diary too dry, and struggle to engage with mindfulness, breathing or counseling apps, emotion trackers and mood journals. \r\n\r\nFor neurodivergent users, Betwixt stands out among ADHD apps for adults by offering a  creative, engaging approach that removes distractions, improves your focus, motivation and mindset without creating digital addiction.\r\n\r\n\u25c6<b> Evidence-based</b>\r\nIndependent psychology research shows that Betwixt can significantly reduce anxiety, stress and depression, with effects that can last months.
