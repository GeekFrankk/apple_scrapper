The algorithm provides relevant medical information on skin diseases (e.g., warts, shingles), skin cancer (e.g., melanoma), and other skin rashes (e.g., hives). In the 2022 Stiftung Warentest, a German consumer organization, this app received satisfaction ratings only slightly lower than paid telemedicine dermatology services.\r\n\r\n- Please capture skin photographs and submit them for analysis. The cropped images will be transferred, but we will not store your data.\r\n- The algorithm provides links to websites that describe the relevant signs and symptoms of skin diseases and skin cancer (e.g., melanoma).\r\n- With the ability to classify images of 186 skin diseases, the algorithm covers common types of skin disorders such as atopic dermatitis, hives, eczema, psoriasis, acne, rosacea, warts, onychomycosis, shingles, melanoma, and nevi.\r\n- The use of the algorithm is FREE.\r\n\r\nHowever, please keep in mind the following disclaimer:\r\n- This app is an image search tool, NOT A DIAGNOSTIC APP.
