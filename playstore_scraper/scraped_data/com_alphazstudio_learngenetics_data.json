    "description": "Genetics is the study of genes and tries to explain what they are and how they work. Genes are how living organisms inherit features or traits from their ancestors; for example, children usually look like their parents because they have inherited their parents' genes. Genetics tries to identify which traits are inherited, and explain how these traits are passed from generation to generation.\r\n\r\nGenes are pieces of DNA that contain information for the synthesis of ribonucleic acids (RNAs) or polypeptides. Genes are inherited as units, with two parents dividing out copies of their genes to their offspring. Humans have two copies of each of their genes, but each egg or sperm cell only gets one of those copies for each gene. An egg and sperm join to form a complete set of genes. The resulting offspring has the same number of genes as their parents, but for any gene, one of their two copies comes from their father, and one from their mother.\r\n\r\n<b>Genetics</b>\r\ngenetics, study of heredity in general and of genes in particular. Genetics forms one of the central pillars of biology and overlaps with many other areas, such as agriculture, medicine, and biotechnology.\r\n\r\nTopics covered in the app are given below:\r\n- Genetics news/blogs\r\n- Genetics cells and DNA\r\n- Health and variants\r\n- How genes work\r\n- Inheriting genetic condition\r\n- Genetics and human traits\r\n- Genetic Consultation\r\n- Genetic Testing\r\n- Direct to consumer genetic testing\r\n- Gene therapy and other medical advance\r\n- Genomic research and precision medicine\r\n\r\nGenetics is termed as the study to understand the functioning of inheritance of traits from parents to offspring. The groundwork on which heredity stands is known as inheritance. It is defined as the procedure by which characteristics are handed down from one generation to the other. Gregor Johann Mendel is known as the \u201cFather of Modern Genetics\u201d for his discoveries on the basic principles of heredity.\r\n\r\nA gene is the basic physical and functional unit of heredity. Genes are made up of DNA. Some genes act as instructions to make molecules called proteins. However, many genes do not code for proteins. In humans, genes vary in size from a few hundred DNA bases to more than 2 million bases. An international research effort called the Human Genome Project, which worked to determine the sequence of the human genome and identify the genes that it contains, estimated that humans have between 20,000 and 25,000 genes.\r\n\r\nIf you like our app then please gave us five star rating.
