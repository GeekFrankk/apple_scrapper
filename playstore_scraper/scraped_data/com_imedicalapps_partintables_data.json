    "description": "\"Urology Partin Tables: Prostate Cancer Evaluation\" is an app to help medical doctor or urologist to predict pathological stage of prostate cancer patients based on commonly available preoperative data (serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, clinical stage, and biopsy Gleason score). For decades, urologists around the world have relied on the tables for counseling patients preoperatively and for surgical planning.\r\n\r\nWhy should you choose \"Urology Partin Tables: Prostate Cancer Evaluation\"?\r\n\ud83d\udd38 Based on the latest Partin Tables nomogram.\r\n\ud83d\udd38 Simple and very easy to use.\r\n\ud83d\udd38 Accurate and precise calculation. \r\n\ud83d\udd38 Prediction of the pathological stage of prostate cancer.\r\n\ud83d\udd38 It is totally free. Download now!\r\n\r\nAround 93% of newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients present with localized or regional disease. The use of \"Urology Partin Tables: Prostate Cancer Evaluation\" app may shift toward identifying men with intermediate-risk to high-risk disease for whom the ratio of treatment benefit to harm may be greatest, or to identify men with low-risk to intermediate-risk disease who may benefit from active surveillance. The results were from an analysis of 5629 men treated with prostatectomy (without additional therapy) between 2006 and 2011 at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. In this app, you should input patient's information regarding clinical stage, serum PSA, and gleason score. \"Urology Partin Tables: Prostate Cancer Evaluation\" app will then calculate the probability of pathological stage (organ confined, extraprotastic extension, seminal vesicle involvement, and lymph node involvement).\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: all calculations must be re-checked and should not be used alone to guide patient care, nor should they substitute for clinical judgment.
