    "description": "Men\u2019s App is an application to take care of your health. It has been created by Dr. Juan Pablo Burgu\u00e9s, urologist and andrologist with extensive professional experience, to inform you about the health problems that concern men. In Men's App, Dr. Burgu\u00e9s talks about such sensitive topics as impotence, premature ejaculation, sexually transmitted diseases, infertility, testosterone deficiency, benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostate cancer, testicular cancer , etc.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter if you are 18 or 70 years old. Men\u2019s App displays content of interest to all age groups. Obviously, sexually transmitted diseases are of more concern to young men, and prostate cancer to more mature men, but all topics are of general interest. It never hurts to learn!\r\n\r\nTraditionally women have always been aware of the need for gynecological checkups from an early age, but not men! It is true that the risk of uterine cancer for women begins earlier than the risk of prostate cancer for men, so urological reviews are not recommended until the 1940s. But, are men aware of this? Definitely not, men are far from women in this regard.\r\n\r\nThat is why in Men\u2019s App the objective of Dr. Juan Pablo Burgu\u00e9s is to raise awareness and disseminate information about health problems that affect men, in a language that is simple and understandable by anyone. You'll also find some useful tools:\r\n\r\n- Shop for men's products, with items carefully selected for their quality and their guarantee of a safe purchase.\r\n- Get expert opinion.\r\n- Self-assessment test on alcoholism.\r\n- Prostate symptoms questionnaire.\r\n- Track your PSA.\r\n- BMI calculator.\r\n- Stop smoking.\r\n- Safe sex.\r\n\r\nYou can use Men\u2019s App as a tool to understand, learn, prevent or follow recommendations, but if you have a problem, it should never replace the consultation with your doctor.\r\n\r\nThe Men\u2019s App activity consists of short tips on men's health at www.mens-app.es, on social networks (Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin) and in the app. In addition, from time to time Dr. Burgu\u00e9s develops a new in-depth topic that is left for offline reading in the \"Topics\" tab of the app. These are some of the men's health problems that are covered in the Men\u2019s App:\r\n\r\n- Benign prostatic hyperplasia\r\n- Testosterone deficiency\r\n- impotence\r\n- infertility\r\n- Premature ejaculation\r\n- Prostate cancer\r\n- Sexually transmitted diseases\r\n- Testicular cancer\r\n\r\nJoin the Men\u2019s App!
