    "description": "HelpMum Vaccination Tracking System is aimed at tackling vaccine related diseases and death in infants of 0 to 5 years old. It is a one of a kind app that helps mothers to save details of their children's birth and vaccination schedule so that they can receive prompt reminders as the date for the next vaccination approaches.\r\n\r\nThe app helps you to:\r\n- Automatically generates your baby's vaccination appointment dates from childbirth till 9 years old\r\n- Input your baby's vaccination details\r\n- Receive reminders every time your baby's vaccination appointment is near to ensure you do not miss any dose\r\n- Provides detailed information about the exact vaccine that should be received at every vaccination appointment.\r\n\r\nThese reminders have proven to be really helpful to mothers, especially those in remote rural areas, in keeping to their babies' vaccination schedule and this is significantly increasing immunisation outcomes in remote areas in Nigeria.\r\n\r\nThe vaccine details also ensures that mothers are better informed about the actual vaccine their baby would be receiving.",
