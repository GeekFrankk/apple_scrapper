Registered AEDs are accessible to emergency call takers and disclosed to those nearby during cardiac arrest events.\r\n\r\nAEDs are lifesaving devices that automatically diagnose and treat cardiac arrest and are commonly available in offices, airports, schools, businesses and other public places.\r\n\r\nThe registry grows when PulsePoint AED app users submit the location of unregistered AEDs in their community, making these lifesaving devices easier to find and use when a cardiac emergency strikes. PulsePoint AED also records and displays other lifesaving resources placed at AED locations, including Bleeding Control Kits, Naloxone (e.g., NARCAN\u00ae) and Epinephrine\r\n(e.g., EpiPen\u00ae).\r\n\r\nWatch this brief video to see just how easy it is to add an AED to the registry\r\nhttps://vimeo.com/pulsepoint/AED-Android\r\n\r\nYou can also add an AED to the registry anytime by simply entering aed.new into your browser.\r\n\r\nIf you are trained in CPR and willing to assist during a nearby cardiac emergency, please consider downloading the companion app, PulsePoint Respond.\r\n\r\nPublic Safety Agencies\r\nThe PulsePoint-hosted Emergency AED Registry is integrated with leading emergency medical dispatch (EMD), pre-arrival instruction, and tactical map vendors, including ProQA Paramount, APCO Intellicomm, PowerPhone Total Response, and RapidDeploy Radius.
