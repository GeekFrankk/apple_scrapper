    "description": "Google Family Link is a parental controls app that helps you keep your family safer online. We know that every family\u2019s relationship with technology is unique, so we designed tools like Family Link that give you the flexibility to choose the right balance for your family, and help them create healthy digital habits. Family Link\u2019s easy to use tools allow you to understand how your child is spending time on their device, see their device location, manage privacy settings, and more.\r\n\r\n\r\n  With Family Link, you can:\r\n\r\n  <b>Establish Digital Ground Rules</b>\r\n  \u2022 Set screen time limits \u2014 Family Link lets you set downtime for your child\u2019s device and time limits for apps, so you can help them find a healthy balance.\r\n  \u2022 Guide them to age-appropriate content \u2014 Approve or block apps your child wants to download. Family Link also allows you to choose the right YouTube experience for your child: a supervised experience on YouTube, or YouTube Kids.\r\n\r\n  <b>Manage and secure your child\u2019s account</b>\r\n  \u2022 Protect their privacy \u2014 Permissions management in Family Link allow you to make meaningful choices about your child\u2019s data. View and manage permissions for websites and extensions accessed through Chrome as well as apps downloaded on your child\u2019s device.\r\n  \u2022 Secure their account \u2014 Family Link gives you access to manage your child's account and data settings. As a parent, you can help change or reset your child\u2019s password if they forget it, edit their personal information or even delete their account if you feel necessary.\r\n\r\n  <b>Stay connected on the go</b>\r\n  \u2022 See where they are \u2014 It\u2019s helpful to be able to find your family when they\u2019re on the go. With Family Link, you can locate your children on one map, as long as they\u2019re carrying their device.\r\n  \u2022 Get notifications and alerts \u2014 Family Link delivers critical notifications including when your child arrives or leaves a certain location. You can also ring devices and view the device\u2019s remaining battery life.\r\n\r\n\r\n  <b>Important Information</b>\r\n\r\n  \u2022 Family Link\u2019s tools vary depending on your child\u2019s device. See a list of compatible devices at https://families.google/familylink/device-compatibility/\r\n  \u2022 While Family Link helps you manage your child's purchases and downloads from Google Play, they will not need approval to install app updates (including updates that expand permissions), apps you have previously approved, or apps that have been shared in Family Library. In addition, purchase approvals will apply only when your child makes a purchase through Google Play\u2019s billing system and will not apply to purchases made through alternate billing systems. Parents should regularly review their child\u2019s installed apps and app permissions in Family Link.\r\n  \u2022 You should carefully review the apps on your child\u2019s supervised device and disable those you don\u2019t want them to use. Note that you may not be able to disable some pre-installed apps such as Play, Google, etc.\r\n  \u2022 To see the location of your child or teen\u2019s device, the device must be powered on, recently active, and connected to the internet through data or wifi.\r\n  \u2022 Family Link parental controls are only available for supervised Google accounts. With supervised Google Accounts, children get access to Google products like Search, Chrome, and Gmail, and parents can set up basic digital ground rules to supervise them.\r\n  \u2022 While Family Link provides tools to manage your child\u2019s online experience and keep them safer online, it does not make the internet safe. Family Link can not determine the content on the internet, but it can give parents the opportunity to make decisions about how their child spends time on their device, and determine what path to online safety looks best for your family.",
