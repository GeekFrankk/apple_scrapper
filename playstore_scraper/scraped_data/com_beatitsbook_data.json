    "description": "Careology supports people living and dealing with cancer to feel connected and in control of their cancer journey.\r\n\r\nWith Careology, you can:\r\n> Manage your symptoms and understand when to contact your clinical team\r\n> Track your vital signs, like temperature, weight, and blood pressure\r\n> Log your medications and get reminders\r\n> Write a treatment journal and notes to yourself\r\n> Keep friends and family up to date\r\n> Get helpful tips and articles to improve your daily wellbeing\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re receiving care from a healthcare provider using Careology Professional, you can also share all of this information about your symptoms, side effects, and well-being with your care team. This information helps your team understand more about how you\u2019re doing so they can provide you with even more personalized care.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re a family, friend or loved one of someone using Careology, they can invite you to connect and view how they're feeling and getting on with treatment. This helps you to support and care for them better.\r\n\r\nThe Careology app has been designed alongside oncology and nursing advisors and is the top-rated cancer care app in an independent review of 400+ apps in the International Journal of Medication Informatics.\r\n\r\nCareology is a secure platform that ensures your data is encrypted and safe, and we will never share your personal information with anybody else.\r\nYes, there will still be down days. But, together, we can help make them more manageable - and make the up days come more often.\r\n\r\nGet in touch\r\nPlease send us your feedback about the app via the 'Contact Careology' link in the sidebar of the app or via www.careology.health/contact-us. We read and respond to every bit of feedback to inform the design of Careology.\r\nDeveloped in collaboration with Guy\u2019s Cancer, one of the world's leading cancer treatment and research centres.\r\n\r\nPartnered with the United Kingdom Oncology Nursing Society\r\nApproved by ORCHA\r\nCyber Essentials Certified\r\nTo learn more about us, visit www.careology.health",
