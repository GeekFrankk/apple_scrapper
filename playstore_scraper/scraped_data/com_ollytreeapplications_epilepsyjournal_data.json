    "description": "Epilepsy Journal is an app which allows you to quickly document daily variables concerning your epilepsy, such as seizure triggers, types etc.  The information you provide is organized into easy to read graphs which allow for quick visualization of your individual epilepsy trends and patterns overtime.  This app can serve as a valuable communication aid,  by allowing you to generate a straightforward and professional report which can be shared with your physicians.\r\n\r\nIn general, we hope that this App will allow you to: \r\n\r\n1) track epilepsy trends and patterns over time\r\n2) objectively determine effectiveness of your epilepsy treatments \r\n3) improve success of doctors appointments\r\n\r\n\r\nEpilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder which affects 1 in 26 people worldwide.  It can have a relapsing, remitting, and unpredictable course.  Treatment of epilepsy can be frustrating, and has been accurately referred to as being similar to the popular \u201cwhack a mole\u201d game.  Whether your epilepsy is mild or severe, refractory or controlled, it is critical to objectively and consistently monitor certain factors such as number of seizures, seizure triggers, AED drug or ketone levels, and other vital information.    Keeping a detailed epilepsy journal will allow you to quickly notice any changes to your epilepsy, as well as provide you with impartial evidence as to whether your epilepsy treatment is truly effective or losing effectiveness over time.  \r\n\r\nApp Features:\r\n- Easy to use\r\n- Record seizure details (as much or as little as you like)\r\n- Visual representation of data \r\n- Generate reports\r\n- Keep track of medications with reminders\r\n- Customizable to fit your individual epilepsy\r\n- Track from your Wear OS watch\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOur Story/ Mission:\r\n\r\nOur daughter Olivia is our inspiration for this app.  Olivia has a refractory and severe epilepsy which began at age 1. Once Olivia\u00b4s epilepsy started we were advised by our physicians to keep a written epilepsy journal, in order to track trends and treatment response overtime.    Although the journal was helpful in allowing us to objectively monitor the effectiveness of her epilepsy treatments, it was very time consuming and tended to be disorganized; As well, the hundreds of pages of notes did not help us when it became most critical to quickly and accurately summarize months worth of seizure history,  (for example during emergency  hospital  visits or follow up appointments).  During our experience navigating the neurology health care system, we found accurate and effective communication to be a key factor in successfully working with doctors and achieving ideal seizure control.   \r\nWe created this app as a free and simple way to monitor your epilepsy; track trends and patterns, objectively determine effectiveness of seizure treatment overtime, and improve success of doctors appointments.\r\nSince epilepsy contains dozens of ever changing variables, we decided to organize data into simple visuals which demonstrate seizure trends and patterns over a time span of months to years.  \r\nOur epilepsy journal allows you to quickly document all the important variables concerning your epilepsy, and to generate a simple and easy to read report to print out or email your doctors.  \r\nWe hope that this app enables you to grasp a better understanding of your own individual epilepsy, and that it empowers you as an effective communicator and advocate within your epilepsy health care team.",
