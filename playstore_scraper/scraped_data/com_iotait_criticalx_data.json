    "description": "Our team is grateful for all of the feedback and emails that have been sent to help us make this app better through the pandemic. The critical community is a lot of fun. There have been a lot of changes to Critical, but this is by far the biggest one yet. During this time, we have done a complete overhaul of the app's UI to make it even better for users. Here is some of the things the team has done based on your feedback.\r\n\r\nNice IPAD Version, great on the iPad mini. Bugs have been fixed in this new version (30). The 02 section for the EC135 tank has been updated to fix them. The ability to change the conversion factor. Added Bell 407 to the list. All over the app, there are new calculators and layouts that you can use. The Peds section added fun a widget that helps you do CPR. In addition, the app's UI has gotten better. This includes the ABG page, the drip (UI changes to the drips show how long it will take to run the next dose), pharmacology (customization), and a lot more. Calcs now have RSBI and BMI added. Smoother animation changes. Of course, there will be speed improvements, major UI changes, small bug fixes, and more!\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease enjoy and let us know how your new Critical experience is!",
