    "description": "The \u201cTreatment guidelines for antimicrobial use in common syndromes\u201d aims to rationalize the usage of antibiotics on National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM) and to establish consistency in the treatment of various infectious conditions. ICMR established AMR surveillance network in 2012 to collect nationally representative data on trends and patterns of AMR to the commonly used antibiotics in pathogens of public health importance. The data emanating from this network has been used to guide the\r\ntreatment of various syndromes.\r\nThe country\u2019s leading infectious disease physicians and clinical microbiologists from leading medical organizations have contributed to this compilation. All recommended therapies are either evidence-based as per universally accepted standards. These are general guidelines; treatment of individual patients may vary depending upon local conditions and experience. The antimicrobial susceptibility data given in this guideline are from selected leading tertiary care hospitals in India and does not represent the\r\ncommunity data. Antimicrobial resistance data is known to differ between different healthcare institutes and between different clinical departments of same institute. Hence each healthcare institute and each clinical department must customize their respective guideline accordingly using ICMR guideline as rational format. ICMR had brought out the first edition of the guideline in 2017. This guideline builds up on the first edition and has additional chapters on skin & soft tissue, bone & joint and CNS infections.",
