    "description": "\"Urology PSA Calculator Pro - Prostate Cancer\" is a medical mobile app designed for health practitioner especially in Urology department. \"Urology PSA Calculator Pro - Prostate Cancer\" app will calculate several measurements regarding prostate specific antigen (PSA). The PSA test is used primarily to screen for prostate cancer. PSA is a protein produced by both cancerous and noncancerous tissue in the prostate. \"Urology PSA Calculator Pro - Prostate Cancer\" will enable urologist to calculate PSA density (PSAD), PSA doubling time (PSADT), and PSA age volume (PSA-AV).\r\n\r\nThere are several features of \"Urology PSA Calculator Pro - Prostate Cancer\", namely:\r\n\ud83d\udd38 Simple and very easy to use app for urologist.\r\n\ud83d\udd38 Precise calculation of PSA density, doubling time, and age volume.\r\n\ud83d\udd38 Useful for management of prostate cancer patient.\r\n\ud83d\udd38 It is totally free. Download now!\r\n\r\nScreening for prostate cancer using prostate-specific antigen (PSA) alone leads to unnecessary biopsy and overdiagnosis. PSA density is easily accessible. PSA density was calculated by dividing serum PSA concentration by gland volume. Using a PSA density cutoff of 0.15 as recommended in the literature enhanced specificity but at the cost of missing half of the tumors.\r\n\r\nPSA doubling time (PSADT) has been studied as a survival measure in prostate cancer. PSA doubling time, or the change in PSA level over time, has emerged as a useful predictive marker for assessing disease outcome in prostate cancer. PSA doubling time can be an indicator of biochemical and clinical progression of prostate cancer. This \"Urology PSA Calculator Pro - Prostate Cancer\" app predicts the changes in PSA levels over time.\r\n\r\nThe PSA-age volume (PSA-AV) score was calculated by multiplying the age and prostate volume and then dividing the total by the prebiopsy PSA level. A PSA-AV score less than 700 had a sensitivity and specificity of 95% and 15%, respectively to predict prostate cancer. The PSA-AV score was more sensitive in younger patients and in patients with a small prostate volume.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: all calculations must be re-checked and should not be used alone to guide patient care, nor should they substitute for clinical judgment. Calculations in this \u201cUrology PSA Calculator Pro - Prostate Cancer\u201d app might be different with your local practice. Consult to expert doctor whenever necessary.",
