You can share this information with your doctors and family as well. No login or setup required, just download the app and get started straight away.\r\n\r\nNEW: Write notes for your appointments to keep a log of conversations with your doctor. This will also show up in your activity timeline.\r\n\r\nYou can look at your seizures on a month by month calendar, or scroll up and down through your seizure activity easily in the timeline view. You can share seizure data via e-mail in files that anyone can download and view on their computer, laptop, tablet, or phone.\r\n\r\nYou can use a wide range of customisable charts as tools to monitor your seizure activity. This is helpful when trying to find patterns or trends in your seizures. These charts are currently available:\r\n- By date\r\n- By length (in minutes)\r\n- By hour of the day (customisable time frames in the settings menu)\r\n- By day of the week\r\n- By preictal symptoms\r\n- By postictal symptoms\r\n- By triggers\r\n\r\nYou can also add your own seizure types if the default specified do not match your seizure types, and then remove any if you wish to. Similarly, you can add and remove preictal and postictal symptoms, as well as seizure triggers.\r\n\r\nI'm adding features regularly so please feel free to send suggestions to the contact email.",
