    "description": "You've brought your baby home and you're ready to get back to your pre-pregnancy form.\r\n\r\nOur workouts are specifically created for new moms looking to build and strengthen their muscles after birth.\r\nThese gentle exercises are perfect for easing your postnatal body into an exercise routine.\r\nFollowing a safe and effective postnatal workout plan will get you on the right track to becoming a happy and healthy new mom.\r\n\r\nGetting your body back post-baby isn't easy, but this postpartum exercise app is a great starting point. Postnatal exercise can help with weight loss and psychological wellbeing. It can also hasten recovery, and assist with muscle strength and toning. Postnatal exercises are important for you to regain the strength of your abdominal muscles, after the birth of your baby.\r\n\r\nJust because you are a mum does not mean you cannot be fit. Finding time to train however is difficult. If you have to think about carving time to get to the gym, train, get back, shower and still fit in all the demands of being a mother then things become truly challenging.\r\n\r\nOne way to regain stability and heal pregnancy-related abdominal issues is through postnatal core workouts. \r\nPostpartum belly fat: we added exercises for a flat belly post pregnancy in just 30 days. You've heard Kegels mentioned from time to time, but just what are these exercises, and what do they do? These invisible exercises strengthen the pelvic floor muscles, and they are great to do both during and after pregnancy. Women who perform Kegel exercises during pregnancy may have an easier time during childbirth because strengthening the pelvic muscles can help a woman control those muscles during labor and delivery\r\n\r\nFeatures :\r\n- Records training progress automatically\r\n- A total of 5 workouts and multiple 30-day challenges\r\n- Create your own workouts\r\n- Increases exercise intensity step by step\r\n\r\nGet a stronger core and pelvic floor after baby with this postpartum workout program.",
