    "description": "We received the \"Tech with Kids' Best Pick Award\" for exceptional design of a children's app. \r\n\r\nLittle Fox has caught a cold. Can you help to find him a cure? The bat has broken its wing. Do you know what to do? \r\n\r\nWhether a bump on the head, a stomach ache from too much candy, a little wound, or a sunburn, these funny animals need the help of a really good doctor! \r\n\r\nFrom Oscar-nominated artist Heidi Wittlinger, the illustrator and director behind the bestseller Apps \u201eNighty Night\u201c, \u201eLittle Fox Music Box\u201c and \u201eNighty Night Circus\u201c comes a wonderful new 3D-App which your child will love! \r\n\r\nThe app is full of humorous animations, amazing 3D illustrations, and funny short movies. In the animal doctor\u2019s office, located in a magical treehouse, the animals are waiting to be cured. Kids are playfully guided through applying treatments that they might have experienced themselves: measuring temperatures, taking medicine, getting a plaster. And of course, eating a snail is probably just good for owls!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \r\n\r\nHighlights:  \r\n\r\n1.There are 7 animals in the App - fox, bat, rabbit, mole, hedgehog, spider and owl, with 21 different injuries, sicknesses, and diseases.                                                                                                      \r\n2.
