It illustrates easy and reproducible methods using different imaging methods.\r\n\r\nThe application covers multiple imaging modalities: radiography, ultrasound, CT and MRI. The modules are divided into six sub-specialties: osteoarticular, cervical region, thorax, cardiovascular, abdomen and pelvis.\r\n\r\nBecause the time available to interpret imaging exams is limited and precious, we have designed a clear and intuitive interface and an optimized search function.\r\nAll content is available offline.
