    "description": "This app was designed and created by Eimear and Aoife, two specialist Pelvic Health Physiotherapists, to support Mums through their postnatal recovery. With a combined experience of 20 years helping women after childbirth, we recognise that Mothers need more support to guide them through the changes in their body after pregnancy. In the UK and Ireland, on average 12 medical appointments are offered in pregnancy, but only one postnatal check-up for Mum!\r\nAlthough experts in postnatal care, we are also Mothers who have been through this journey and understand how vulnerable and unprepared you can feel. Pregnancy and delivery takes it toll on the body, but when baby arrives Mum\u2019s recovery often takes a back seat. This app provides Mothers with the advice and support we feel they deserve. Including pelvic floor reminders and 84 daily videos focusing on pelvic floor rehabilitation, general strengthening to help your body meet the demands of motherhood and advice from a team of medical professionals to help guide you through the 4th trimester.\r\nNo topic is off limits, we talk about constipation, sex, leaking, hormones, prolapse,farting, diastasis, back pain and return to exercise after birth. We discuss each of these openly and honestly to normalise what women may experience after birth, and offer practical and professional advice that many mums need after delivery. \r\nA number of other women\u2019s health experts feature within the app. Topics they cover include skin changes after pregnancy, coping with parenting, postnatal mental health, stitches care, pain management, bleeding, tears explained, nutrition, birth trauma, hemorrhoids, contraceptives, smear tests and hair loss. \r\nThe app also includes 30 rehabilitation sessions led by women\u2019s health Physiotherapists, to reconnect your core, strengthen your pelvic floor and prepare your body for the daily demands of motherhood. And for those interested in returning to exercise, these sessions will help you on your way. \r\nThe importance of pelvic floor exercises cannot be underestimated after pregnancy but when baby arrives its hard to find the time or even remember to do them. This is why the app also includes a daily reminder for pelvic floor rehab and numerous videos on how to do them correctly. Download this app now, your future self will thank you!",
