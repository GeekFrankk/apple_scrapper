    "description": "VOKA Anatomy Pro is a unique complete catalog of medically accurate 3D models of human anatomy and pathologies, including rare diseases. This mobile atlas is designed to be always at hand for medical students, lecturers, and doctors: to view the models on the required scale, from any angle, both inside and out. It provides additional clarity to pathology understanding and learning, making it much easier. \r\n\r\nOur focus is to provide visible, really true-to-life three-dimensional visualization of human applied e-anatomy and pathologies. Each and every 3D anatomy model is developed in close cooperation with top-notch medical professionals of research centers, based on actual DICOM data from CT/MRI, thought out to the very smallest detail, and verified by the medical advisory board.\r\n\r\nAll 3D models are labeled, dissected, and segmented to facilitate configuration meeting any visualization needs. For instance, you can hide the outer membrane, which opens up the maximum field of view of the pathology and facilitates understanding its anatomy. In addition to all possible types of pathologies (larynx, spasticity), each c ategory of the catalog includes smart reference anatomy 3D models of healthy organs.\r\n\r\nVOKA CT. Anatomy Pro 5 visualizer map is empowered with an AR mode that lets you overlay virtual 3D men models on the real world and study human head, circulatory systems, nose, skull, spine, thoracic, foot, cranial nerves - anatomy & pathologies in augmented reality.
