From traditional cytotoxic agents to targeted genomic, epigenomic, hormonal, and immunotherapeutic agents, this reference covers the staggering advances in cancer pharmacology that are propelling new standards of care for common and uncommon malignancies. Beautifully illustrated throughout, each chapter contains visually engaging figures detailing the tumor microenvironment, chemical structures of agents, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, pharmacogenomic, and molecular properties of the various agents, and their mechanisms of action. As the first illustrated book of its kind, this highly visual text uses a uniform approach to each cancer drug class and agent presented in the book, and covers alkylating agents, antimetabolites, antimitotics, epigenetic modulators, hormonal agents, targeted therapies, monoclonal antibodies, immunotherapeutic agents, and much more. Flow diagrams, clinical tables, and bulleted text further explain important information pertaining to each cancer drug class including their indications, mechanisms of action, potential adverse reactions, dosing and dose adjustments, and safety monitoring.
