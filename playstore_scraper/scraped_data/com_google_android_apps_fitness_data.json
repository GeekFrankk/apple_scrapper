    "description": "Get to a healthier and more active life with the new Google Fit!\r\n\r\nIt's hard to know how much or what kind of activity you need to stay healthy. That's why Google Fit collaborated with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Heart Association (AHA) to bring you Heart Points, an activity goal that can help improve your health.\r\n\r\nActivities that get your heart pumping harder have tremendous health benefits for your heart and mind. You'll earn one Heart Point for each minute of moderate activity like picking up the pace when walking your dog, and double points for more intense activities like running. It takes just 30-minutes of brisk walking five days a week to reach the AHA and WHO's recommended amount of physical activity shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep, and increase overall mental wellbeing.\r\n\r\nGoogle Fit will also help you:\r\n\r\nTRACK YOUR WORKOUTS FROM YOUR PHONE OR WATCH\r\nGet instant insights when you exercise and see real-time stats for your runs, walks, and bike rides. Fit will use your Android phone's sensors or Wear OS by Google smartwatch's heart rate sensors to record your speed, pace, route, and more.\r\n\r\nMONITOR YOUR GOALS\r\nSee your daily progress on your Heart Points and Steps goal. Meeting your goals all the time? Easily adjust your goals to keep challenging yourself to achieve a healthy heart and mind.\r\n\r\nMAKE ALL YOUR MOVEMENT COUNT\r\nIf you walk, run, or bike throughout the day, your Android phone or Wear OS by Google smartwatch will automatically detect and add your activities to your Google Fit journal to ensure you get credit for every move. Want extra credit? Turn up the tempo on your walks by starting a paced walking workout and stepping to the beat. Enjoy a different type of workout? Select it from a list of activities like pilates, rowing, or spinning, and Google Fit will track all the Heart Points you earn.\r\n\r\nCONNECT WITH YOUR FAVORITE APPS AND DEVICES\r\nFit can show you info from many of your favorite apps and devices to give you a holistic view of your health, so you'll never lose track of your progress. These include Lifesum, Wear OS by Google, Nike+, Runkeeper, Strava, MyFitnessPal, Basis, Sleep as Android, Withings, Xiaomi Mi bands, and more.\r\n\r\nCHECK IN AT ANYTIME, FROM ANYWHERE\r\nSee a snapshot of your activity history across Fit and your integrated apps in the redesigned journal.
