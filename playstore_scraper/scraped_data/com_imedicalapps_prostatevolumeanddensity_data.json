    "description": "\"Urology Prostate Calculator: Volume and Density\" app is designed to help health professional to assess patients with prostate enlargement (BPH or prostate cancer). \"Urology Prostate Calculator: Volume and Density\" app will help to estimate prostate volume and prostate specific antigen (PSA) density. Tumor volume is used, along with the Gleason Score, to prognosticate prostate cancer recurrence. PSA density helps distinguish between BPH and prostate cancer and determine the need for prostate biopsy.\r\n\r\nWhy should you choose \"Urology Prostate Calculator: Volume and Density\"?\r\n\ud83d\udd38 Simple and very easy to use.\r\n\ud83d\udd38 Accurate and precise calculation of prostate volume and PSA density.\r\n\ud83d\udd38 There are two volume formulas to calculate prostate volume, namely ellipsoid and bullet volume.\r\n\ud83d\udd38 Calculation of PSA density to determine the need for prostate biopsy.\r\n\ud83d\udd38 It is totally free. Download now!\r\n\r\n\"Urology Prostate Calculator: Volume and Density\" app could calculate prostate volume with two formulas, especially ellipsoid volume and bullet volume. This feature is very useful for physician in urology clinic when handling patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) or prostate cancer. The normal prostate volume is 15 to 30 cc. Men with prostate volume larger than 30 cc are more likely to be diagnosed with BPH or prostate cancer. \"Urology Prostate Calculator: Volume and Density\" app is also a practical medical calculator to calculate PSA density. PSA density is PSA divided by prostate volume. PSA density is said to be superior than PSA alone in detecting prostate cancer.\r\n\r\nFor more info contact us at:\r\nwww.imedical-apps.com",
