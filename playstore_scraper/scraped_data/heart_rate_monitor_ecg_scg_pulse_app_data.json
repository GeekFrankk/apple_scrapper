    "description": "HeartScan is an AI-based app that helps you easily monitor your heart performance, from the comfort of your own home.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing more important to human health than the heart.\r\n\r\nSeismocardiography (SCG) is a technique of measuring the vibrations produced by the beating heart, where those vibrations are recorded from the chest. HeartScan app uses your smartphone's embedded accelerometer and gyroscope to record your SCG. After the recording, the app uses advanced mathematical algorithms to analyze your SCG and extract information about your heart.\r\n\r\nUsing the app is fast and easy. Simply lay flat on your back, otherwise known as the supine position, start the app, and place the phone on your chest. Wait 1 minute for the data to be collected and check the results right there onscreen.\r\n\r\nWhat does the app measure and present?\r\n\r\n\u2022 An SCG chart with all recorded cardiac cycles. A cardiac cycle is a full process from the beginning of one heartbeat to the beginning of the next. The length of time between successful heartbeats can vary by up to 20%, but if the differences are longer or erratic, you may need to investigate this further.\r\n\u2022 Heart rate. You can use the HeartScan app as a resting heart rate monitor, and get a very accurate measure of the heart rate. This is much more meticulous than pulsometer apps that rely on the phone's camera and finger for a pulse \u2013 HeartScan goes right to the \"heart\" of the matter.\r\n\u2022 Length of each recorded cardiac cycle, which makes it possible to use the app as an hrv monitor.\r\n\u2022 Distribution of the lengths of all recorded cardiac cycles.\r\n\u2022 Combined cardiac cycle.\r\n\u2022 Clear signs of abnormalities that may need attention and further detection by a healthcare professional.\r\n\r\nYou can save your measurements and view them later using the history section of the app so you can track and monitor your progress over time.\r\n\r\nHeartScan also offers the ability to export your measurement results in a convenient PDF format. This feature enables easy sharing of your data with healthcare professionals and provides a flexible way to track your progress. Maintain a digital record of your heart health journey and access your important data whenever you need it.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT:\r\nTHIS APPLICATION IS INTENDED TO BE USED BY ADULTS\r\nTHIS APPLICATION SHOULD NOT BE USED BY A PERSON WITH A PACEMAKER\r\nTHIS APPLICATION IS NOT A MEDICAL DEVICE AND IS NOT FOR MEDICAL PURPOSES\r\nPLEASE REMEMBER THAT THE HEARTSCAN APP IS NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR THE PROFESSIONAL EXPERTISE OF A HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL.
