    "description": "The Vaccination Certificate Verification (VCV) Application is a Malaysian Government application to verify the COVID-19 vaccination certificate issued by the Malaysian government; and also by other countries, as recognized by the Malaysian government.  This app will also verify certificates for COVID test outcomes and recovery by some countries.\r\n\r\nVCV users can verify these certificate by scanning a QR code displayed on:-\r\n(1) the MySejahtera application, or its equivalent as used in another country, \r\n(2) an electronic version of the certifcate ie on PDF form, or\r\n(3) a printed paper version of the certifcate.\r\n\r\nVCV verifies two categories of certificate QR codes containing:-\r\n(1) URL of a trusted server that points to identity and vaccination information. This verification requires internet connectivity.\r\n(2) Identity and vaccination information with a digital signature issued by a trusted entity. For this verification, internet connectivity is not required because the list of trusted public keys is stored in VCV.\r\n\r\nVCV will be updated periodically to maintain the list of trusted servers and trusted public keys.\r\n\r\nVCV will display the result of vaccination certificate verification. Identity and vaccination information is displayed only if the vaccination certificate is valid. VCV is designed to not retain certificate information, as a privacy protective measure.\r\n\r\nThe present version of this application is able to verify certificates from the following countries:-\r\n- Malaysia\r\n- All countries that have been accepted into the European Union (EU) Digital COVID Certificate (DCC) consortium.   This consortium includes 27 EU countries, and 40 non-EU countries and jurisdictions, at this publication of this version of the VCV.\r\n- Brunei\r\n- India\r\n- Indonesia\r\n- Philippines\r\n- Syria\r\n- Australia",
