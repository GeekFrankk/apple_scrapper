By applying this process clinicians will be able to recognize specific diseases and prescribe the most effective therapy.\r\n \r\nEach chapter is built around a common patient complaint that illustrates essential concepts and provides insight into the process by which the differential diagnosis is identified.  As the case progresses, clinical reasoning is explained in detail. The differential diagnosis for that particular case is summarized in tables that highlight the clinical clues and important tests for the leading diagnostic hypothesis and alternative diagnostic hypotheses. As the chapter progresses, the pertinent diseases are reviewed. Just as in real life, the case unfolds in a stepwise fashion as tests are performed and diagnoses are confirmed or refuted.\r\n \r\nCompletely updated to reflect the latest research in clinical medicine, this fourth edition is enhanced by algorithms, summary tables, questions that direct evaluation, and an examination of recently developed diagnostic tools and guidelines. Clinical pearls are featured in every chapter. Coverage for each disease includes: Textbook Presentation, Disease Highlights, Evidence-Based Diagnosis, and Treatment.\r\n\r\nChanges include new algorithms and approaches in the chapters on Chest Pain, Syncope, Dizziness, and others. Recently developed new diagnostic tools are discussed in the chapters of Diarrhea, Jaundice, and Cough and Fever, and new guidelines have been included in the chapters on Screening, Diabetes, and Hypertension\r\n\r\nContent licensed from printed edition ISBN 10: 1260121119\r\nContent licensed from printed edition ISBN 13: 978-1260121117\r\n\r\nSUBSCRIPTION :\r\nPlease choose an auto renewable subscription plan to receive content access and continuous updates.
