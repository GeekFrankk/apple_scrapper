    "description": "Save up to 80% on prescription medication. \r\n\r\nCompare prescription drug prices and discover hundreds of coupons & discounts. \r\n\r\n\r\nPharmaceutical pricing has always been extremely opaque. A lifesaving medication may cost $100 at one pharmacy and $10 at another. RxGo.com understands that high medication costs can prove to be an extreme financial hardship for many hard-working families across the US.\r\n\r\nOur software allows everyone to compare pricing at nearby pharmacies and print coupons to further lower their costs. Since its inception in 2012 RxGo has saved patients tens of millions of dollars.\r\n\r\nHere are what a few people have said about RxGo:\r\n\r\nI work at a pharmacy and we often have people coming with discount cards from various companies in order to cut the cost of their medicine. We, at the pharmacy, often will take the coupon and compare it with other prices on other coupons for them to make sure we get them the lowest price. Since we\u2019ve started using RxGo as one of the discount programs we check, we\u2019ve all been amazed by how much more money it saves people on most prescriptions. It really does have the lowest price on almost everything we regularly dispense and still for the less common medicine too!\r\n-\tRyan K.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cI wanted to say thank you and yes I have used my card already and have saved $312 just in one month. It was hard to get my medications without help from family and friends but now I think I might be able to handle it on my own. Thank you so much\u201d\r\n-\tJessica L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cI just got back from a month\u2019s vacation to Africa! I was quite busy before that trying to get everything ready to go. BUT\u2026I wanted to let you know of my success with using your coupons. In order to go to Africa, I needed to take anti-malaria pills daily while I was there. Using your card I was able to save $157.18!!\"\r\n-\tJeannie M.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cTotally awesome pharmacy trip my meds went from $70 to $17 with your card thank you!!\u201d\r\n-\tE. Ison",
