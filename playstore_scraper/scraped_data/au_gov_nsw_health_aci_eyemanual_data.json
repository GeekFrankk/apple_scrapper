They are not a definitive statement on the correct procedures rather they constitute a general guide to be followed subject to the clinician\u2019s judgment in each case. The consensus opinion provided is based on the best information available at the time of writing.\r\n\r\nTo help with ease of use, this manual has a high graphic content, and is subdivided into anatomy, basic ophthalmic workup (history, examination, diagnostic techniques and treatment), and management of common eye presentations. \r\n\r\nEach of the presenting conditions is subdivided into the following sections:\r\n\r\n \u2022 Immediate action (if any)\r\n \u2022 History\r\n \u2022 Examination\r\n \u2022 Treatment\r\n \u2022 Follow-up - When to refer?\r\n\r\nPermissions Info:\r\nVersion 2.0 of this app adds the permission \"Write to External Storage\", this permission is used to allow you to download the PDF resources found throughout the app to your device, if you do not wish to download PDFs this permission is NOT used, in newer versions of Android you do not have to grant the permission until you do wish to download a PDF.",
