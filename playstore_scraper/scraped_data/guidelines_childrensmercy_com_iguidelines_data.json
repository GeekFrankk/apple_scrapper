    "description": "In our commitment to creating a world of well-being for all children, Children\u2019s Mercy Kansas City has created PedsGuide as a means for evidence-based pediatric clinical support guidelines to be available to health care providers.\r\n\r\nPedsGuide is a multi-module pediatric clinical decision support tool intended for use only by professional health care providers and emergency personnel for informational and educational purposes. *Each module provides users with a step-by-step interactive clinical decision support process, including reference material and/or contextually relevant information based on evidence-based practice and expert opinion routinely used in clinical practice, to assist in management of various acute illnesses in children. \r\n\r\nThe modules have been designed and optimized by an interdisciplinary team of clinicians, pharmacists, medical librarians, Human Factors scientists, and innovations professionals. Human Factors methodology was leveraged to guide interfaces that provide rapid access to information and assessment tools, which facilitate an efficient aid for care management while decreasing cognitive load for the user. Additionally, for users who seek care for patients at The Children\u2019s Mercy Hospital, PedsGuide features a quick-call feature to contact the Children\u2019s Mercy Contact Center and Critical Care Transport Team in our service area. \r\n\r\n*While PedsGuide is a helpful tool, it is not intended to replace the independent judgment and evaluation of health care providers and emergency personnel. Healthcare providers and emergency personnel should not rely primarily on the tool to make a clinical diagnosis or treatment decision.
