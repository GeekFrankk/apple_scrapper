    "description": "Rescue Dash is a fascinating city rescue game. We took everything that's not a boring story about a restaurant or hotel, where everything is turning into a frenzy, but a very addictive puzzle adventure!\r\nThe city is plunged into a real chaos: all the animals in the local zoo have escaped! Seals, dogs, rabbits, raccoons - all of them must be rescued and returned home! The rescue team led by the brave Jessica is in a hurry to help everyone and help the city to regain peace and order! Exciting challenges are waiting! See those children stuck on a ferris wheel? Don\u2019t let them fall and get to a clinic, save them and make their parents happy! Walk the whole adventure with her and acquire new friends and a cheerful mood.\r\n\r\nHelp\r\nThis is a casual game for anyone who dreams of becoming a rescuer and helping people in an emergency. Don\u2019t miss the opportunity to bask in the glory of your good deeds! This game gives you a chance to make this dream come true! Now city residents are in a panic!Wild animals roam the streets, fire burns diner, broken hydrants spray water all over the street\u2026What are they gonna do when their familiar homescapes are thrown into chaos? Who, if not rescuers, can dash off and restore the normal way of life!\r\n\r\nVariety of locations and emergency situations\r\nLifeguards are needed everywhere! Get to work in a hotel, supermarket, cruise liner, restaurant, movie studio and farm. You will have to drive a fire truck, remove trash, rebuild roads and renovate buildings, save animals and feed them tasty treats.\r\nTry yourself as a firefighter, beach lifeguard, and emergency worker! This is not just making patiens happy in a clinic or dash in trying to deliver plates in a diner. To complete your mission, you need speed, ingenuity, and the ability to be a team player!\r\n\r\nResource management\r\nIn the course of the quest, you will need resources that have yet to be collected. Develop your own strategy to help you complete tasks in the way as efficiently as possible. Don't just rush into this as if you are playing some restaurant cooking games, running back and forth in madness to the kitchen, or hospital and hotel games with monotonous decorating mania. You should use your brain to win!And don't forget about the time limit! Try to solve puzzles in time!\r\n\r\nHarder with each step!\r\nThe complexity of the puzzle adventure increases with each next level, which means you won't get bored.

And of course solving puzzles and saving the day together is always more enjoyable.\r\n\r\nMore possibilities!\r\nWhile in various cooking games, hotel games or hospital games you need to renovate some space and buy appliances, in Rescue Dash you become one with your lifeguard character. Prove to your teammates that you are the best rescuer in this city! You can pump up your hero faster if you buy additional packages of resources and bonuses.\r\n\r\nEnjoy the classic casual gameplay\r\nTime management games are timeless classics of casual games.
