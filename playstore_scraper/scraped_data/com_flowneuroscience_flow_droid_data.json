    "description": "The Flow depression treatment is a free personal guide to help you understand, treat & prevent depression and improve your mental health.\r\n\r\nFlow represents a new chapter in the understanding and treatment of depression, based on the latest psychology and neuroscience research.\r\n\r\nThe app can be used on its own and offers a therapy programme with over 50 therapy sessions. The sessions cover a range of topics from behavioural therapy and lifestyle habits, such as, meditation, sleep, diet and exercise. To track changes over time, the app includes the MADRS-s depression test.\r\n\r\nTogether with the Flow brain stimulation headset, the app offers a holistic approach to treating depression. The type of stimulation used in the Flow headset, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), has long been used in clinical settings to treat depression. With Flow, you can now access tDCS in a remote device from your own home. To use the headset you will need the app. \r\n\r\nThe Flow treatment is based on decades of clinical research and is supported by more than 20 randomised double-blind studies. The Flow headset is approved as a medical device (CE) in the EU and UK for the treatment of depression. Order it at: https://flowneuroscience.com\r\n\r\nThe programme contains over 50 sessions split into 7 courses, covering topics such as:\r\n\r\n- Exercise\r\n\r\nPhysical exercise has been shown to have a similar effect to antidepressant medication when it comes to reducing and preventing depressive symptoms. Flow will tell you what type of exercise is beneficial and the optimal \u201cdose\u201d.\r\n\r\n- Meditation\r\n\r\nMeditation is practised by many people around the world as mental \u201cexercise\u201d for the brain. Flow will give you concrete exercises to follow but also show you the neurological basis of why meditation is good for managing stress in your everyday life.\r\n\r\n- Sleep\r\n\r\nDid you know that sleeping for only six hours each night for two nights in a row is equivalent to being continuously awake for 24 hours? Flow will educate you on sleep hygiene, why we sleep and why sleeping is one of four important pillars for overcoming depression.\r\n\r\n- Nutrition\r\n\r\nThe nutrition sessions will advise and encourage you to eat in a way that science has proven reduces inflammation in the brain, thereby alleviating depression. Spoiler alert: sugar is one of the big villains.",
