    "description": "Nia is an eczema app equipped with artificial intelligence that offers relief and individually tailored support to those affected. Are you or your loved ones affected by eczema? Increase your day-to-day well-being from the comfort of your home and at any time with our award-winning eczema app!\r\n\r\nHow exactly does Nia work? As a personal assistant, Nia helps patients to better understand their own health (or their affected child's) on a daily basis by simply documenting their health progress. Patients and relatives receive directly applicable and medically validated recommendations.\r\n\r\nThis is how Nia supports you with eczema:\r\n\r\n- Take control of your skin condition: Highlight affected areas on the body chart, take pictures and document the current severity of your eczema (also known as atopic dermatitis). This will give you and your doctor the best possible overview of the progression of your health.\r\n\r\n- Understand the triggers: Atopic dermatitis flare-ups have highly individualized triggers. Document each flare-up using pictures and scales as soon as they appear. Over time, valuable insights and patterns can be derived from the eczema diary that help to identify your specific triggers.\r\n\r\n- Get direct eczema help: You can contact eczema experts directly via Nia. Our doctors will give you specific recommendations based on your input. This makes holistic assessments easier. In Nia's knowledge area you also get easy-to-implement tips & tricks.\r\n\r\n- Nia Premium: If the free basic version is not enough for you, we offer you even more content and helpful functions in our premium version. \r\n\r\nGet comprehensive digital support for greater well-being now!\r\n\r\n- Cooperation with leading health insurance companies: We are already cooperating with leading German health insurance companies and actively extending these to include more regional providers. When you are insured with one of our partners, you will receive the full premium version of Nia free of charge. In our experience, private health insurers are also very accommodating when it comes to reimbursing the Nia premium version. \r\n\r\n- Award-winning innovation: The Eczema App Nia is a multi-award winning app.  The medical journal e-health-com named the Nia app \u201cApp of the Month\u201d for January 2020. Mein-Allergie-Portal also presented the Digital Health Heroes Award to Nia Health. Additionally, Nia Health attracted international attention with the EU Innovation Award EIT Health Headstart Award.
