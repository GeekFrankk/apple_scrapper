    "description": "Face IT DNA Technology is a big deal. It uses a similar theory to what's used to unlock your mobile phone or office building using your face. It takes the facial profile of one person, calculates the unique facial points, then compares them to another person to see if those two people could possibly be related.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s an example of how DNA Face Matching and Ancestry Face Matching Works: Our face recognition technology will scan several facial features, for example the alleged father's eyes and compare that calculation to the shape of the potential child\u2019s eyes. You could even compare the facial profiles of one sibling to another sibling. Various algorithms are in place that allow a grandparent, sibling, father, child, aunt, uncle or a cousin to verify relationship. Face Match DNA Technology has the capability to do this with 60+ facial points. For example, the nose, cheeks, ears, head, chin and several other parts of the human face. We use 68 different facial points!\r\n\r\n\u2714 Studies have shown DNA Face Matching to be as high as 92% accurate. \r\n\r\nThe best photos to send are photos looking straight forward into the camera. Sometimes your head can be slightly turned and still pick up the calculations (don\u2019t worry no photo will ever be perfect). The older the person is the more mature their facial features are; therefore, the more recent the photo is the more precise the results usually are. Some people choose to use pictures of relatives at a younger age, even infancy. Yes, baby photos can work as well.\r\n\r\nSimply go to our website or your app store, upload the photos of the two people you\u2019d like to compare facial features on, make your payment and sit back and wait for same-day results. Results are available on our app and via email. Facial recognition services will never replace an actual mouth swab or blood DNA test, but the industry is ever-growing and is now used globally to give a strong probability of relationship without having to come into an office. \r\n\r\n\u2714 Start your facial scan now and unlock answers to your important questions today!\r\n\r\nElectronic DNA Facial Point Connectivity \u201cEDFPC\u201d is a biometric process that uses unique patterns to manually scan human faces. DNA Face Matching scans the human face and then compares related facial traits to another person\u2019s facial traits. The Face Match process allows experts to determine certain genetic traits inherited by an alleged family member.\r\n\r\n\u201cFACE IT\u2122, uses DNA Face Matching algorithms to assist in manually scanning the:\r\n\r\n\u2714 Facial Pattern\r\n\u2714 Eyebrow Pattern\r\n\u2714 Eye Pattern\r\n\u2714 Nose Pattern\r\n\u2714 Ear Pattern\r\n\u2714 Lip Pattern\r\n\u2714 Mouth Pattern\r\n\u2714 Cheek Pattern\r\n\u2714 Head Pattern\r\n\u2714 Chin Pattern\r\n\u2714 Skin Tone\r\n\r\nThe cost for the VALUE Package is $15.00.
