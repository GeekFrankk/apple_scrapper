    "description": "As humans, we\u2019re hardwired for connection. Belonging to a community makes us feel safe and helps us thrive. \r\n \r\nBut so often, living with breast cancer (BC) can make you feel physically and emotionally isolated. Not only can it be hard to do things you loved before your diagnosis, but it can also feel like no one understands what it\u2019s like.\r\n \r\nUntil now.\r\n\r\nOur mission is to cultivate a space powered by the BC community and empowered by each other. From one-to-one chats to conversation forums, we make connecting easy. This is a safe place to find and receive advice, to seek and offer support, and to discover the authentic stories of members, just like you.\r\n \r\nBezzy BC is a free online platform bringing new meaning to the word \u201ccommunity.\u201d \r\n \r\nOur aim is to create an experience where:\r\n- everyone feels seen, valued, and understood\r\n- everyone\u2019s story matters\r\n- shared vulnerability is the name of the game\r\n \r\nBezzy BC is a place where you are more than your BC.
