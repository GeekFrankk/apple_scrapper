    "description": "I'm developing this app on my own in my spare time outside of work, so that I can continue to offer it for free.\r\n\r\nThis app is free, ad-free, and without data collection. Forever.\r\n\r\nLife Notes is an app that allows you to record your chronic symptoms and lifestyle habits on a daily basis in order to monitor them, but also to potentially highlight some correlations.\r\n\r\nIt's possible to create your own symptom list in order to score them day after day, rating thef pain level intensity on a scale from 0 to 5.\r\n\r\nIt's also possible to record your meals, medications and add various notes, as well as your sleep schedules to highlight the causes of your symptoms. For example, it is easier to highlight the link between some of your meals and your possible stomach aches.\r\n\r\nIn addition to noting the daily evolution of the symptoms at different times of the day, it's also possible to enter an overall level of pain intensity over the course of a day in order to have a broader view of their evolution.\r\n\r\nIn short, Life-Notes offers what a simple notebook could do for you, but with a focus on tracking symptoms and providing statistics.\r\n\r\nNone of your data is sent online, 100% of your data is stored on your phone's memory.\r\nIf a problem occurs while saving your data, you can contact me at the email address below, I will explain the manual data recovery method (Settings > Advanced)\r\n\r\nAvailable languages: English, French\r\n\r\nFeel free to send me your remarks / ideas for improvements / bug reports to contact@sebferrer.fr :)\r\n\r\nThis project is open source : https://github.com/sebferrer/life-notes",
