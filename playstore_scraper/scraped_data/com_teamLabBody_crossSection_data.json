    "description": "teamLabBody Pro is a human anatomy app that covers the entire human body, from muscles to bone structures, blood vessels, nerves, and ligaments, as well as internal organs and the brain, based on MRI data on the human body accumulated over more than 10 years by Dr. Kazuomi Sugamoto (supervisor of teamlabbody and former professor of Sponsored Courses at the Graduate School of Medicine and Faculty of Medicine, Osaka University). By providing both overall and detailed views of the human body through organ cross sections (2D) and three-dimensional animation of bones and joints (4D), this app helps users learn seamlessly about the human structure, more intuitively than with traditional publications on human anatomy, kinematics, and medical images.\r\n\r\n\u25a0 Characteristics\r\n3D human model covering the entire body\r\nZoom in and out, seamlessly and instantly, from the human body in its entirety to detailed views of organs such as the peripheral vascular system. View a three-dimensional structure of the human body from any angle, realized by Unity Technologies\u2019 Game Engine.\r\nAn accurate reproduction of the live human body\r\nThis app was created by reproducing the organs in the average human body as a virtual 3D model, based on MRI data accumulated over 10+ years.\r\nThe world\u2019s first three-dimensional visual representation of joint movement in the live human body\r\nThree-dimensional movement  (4D) of joints based on analysis of MRI images shot from multiple positions - revolutionizing the content of existing kinesiology textbooks, written using cadavers.\r\nView cross sections of the human body from any angle\r\nAlthough the sagittal plane, frontal plane, and horizontal plane of the human body can be observed through MRI and CT images, a new function on this app allows users to acquire detailed information about organs at any angle, practical for ultrasound diagnosis.\r\n\u25a0 Main Functions\r\nView the virtual 3D model of the human body in its entirety, or the several thousand body parts individually.\r\nSelect individual parts, such as muscles, bones, nerves, blood vessels, etc.\r\nNavigate through different layers of the human anatomy by using the slide bar function.\r\nSwitch between \u201cShow\u201d, \u201cSemi-Transparent\u201d, and \u201cHide\u201d to choose how to display an organ or category. By choosing to show certain organs with \u201cSemi-Transparent\u201d mode, users can identify where the organs are situated three-dimensionally in the human body. \r\nLook up organs according to their medical names. Users can identify where that organ is situated in the human body through \u201cSemi-Transparent\u201d mode.\r\nSave organs to your Favorites to find them again easily.\r\nCreate up to 100 tags for various body parts to instantly display desired conditions.\r\nNote down important information you want to keep with the Paint function (up to 100 notes).\r\nUse search filters to identify organs, even if you don\u2019t know their names.\r\n\r\n\u25a0 Languages\r\nJapanese, English, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese\r\n\r\n\u25a0 About Dr. Kazuomi Sugamoto\r\nProfessor Kazuomi Sugamoto\u2019s laboratory research team of the Biomaterial Science research center at Osaka University have developed the world's first method of orthopedic disease treatment by analyzing joint movement in three dimensions.\r\nAs a result, this method revealed that voluntary movements of living human beings are different from involuntary movements observed in donor bodies.
