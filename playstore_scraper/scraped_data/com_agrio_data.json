    "description": "<big>Agrio is a <b>precision plant protection</b> solution that helps growers and crop advisors to forecast, identify, and treat plant diseases, pests, and nutrient deficiencies. Agrio leverages and deploys proprietary artificial intelligence and computer vision algorithms to help farmers, crop advisors, agronomists and home growers in crop management, <b>plant disease identification</b>, <b>plant diagnosis</b>, and yield improvement. The digital plant doctor contains the knowledge of numerous agriculture experts from all over the world and continuously improves. We offer a multi-layered approach to keeping your plants healthy with a focus on forecast and prevention. Our solution includes the following features:</big>\r\n\r\n \ud83e\udd33\ud83c\udffd <b> Plant disease identification and <b>plant diagnosis</b> app that acts as a plant doctor and helps to identify <b>plant diseases</b> and problems in smartphone-captured images</b>. Based on images of sick crops, we provide you with a <b>plant diagnosis</b> and solution within seconds. We provide detailed <b>integrated pest management (IPM)</b> protocols to optimize yield and crop quality and reduce treatment costs.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udef0 <b>Effortless monitoring of fields</b>. Monitoring crop progress and spotting problems before symptoms are apparent is crucial for a successful harvest. We offer you the opportunity to access <b>satellite imagery</b> to make monitoring problems and growth progress easy. We provide a frequent evaluation of the NDVI and chlorophyll indices of your fields. Once you have defined your field on the map, we will send notifications when new satellite data is available and offer you our interpretation and recommendations. We have several different packages that offer a wide array of satellite options. You can receive NDVI and Chlorophyll scans every day in 3-meter resolution if you wish. You can leverage satellite insights to know when and where to act and scout problematic regions. Moreover, monitoring NDVI and chlorophyll indices allows you to apply variable-rate fertilizer and practice site-specific crop management. \r\n\r\n\ud83d\udd75\ud83c\udffb <b>Organized field listings by crops and farms</b>.  Farm management solution that helps you keep a detailed record of field interventions and scouting findings.\r\n\r\n\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udf3e\ud83d\udd75\ud83c\udffb <b>Collaborative tool</b>. Agrio has farm management features that allow you to create teams, share notes, communicate insights, and easily manage tasks.\r\n\r\n\u26c5\ufe0f <b>Weather data</b>. We provide you with an hourly hyper-local <b>weather forecast</b> with state-of-the-art accuracy. Track weather at the field level, and receive accurate alerts for potential <b>plant diseases</b> and pests. In addition, we calculate the <b>growing degree days (GDD)</b> for you to help you estimate the plant growth stage. We provide pest life-cycle modeling to help you optimize the timing of pesticide applications, and forecast new generation emergence.\r\n\r\n\u26a0\ufe0f <b>Warning notifications</b>. We send <b>alerts</b> when problems are likely to occur in your area. This allows you to protect your plants from pests and diseases, and apply preventative measures early on. \r\n\r\n\ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2640\ufe0f <b>Easily shareable digital reports</b>. Agrio enables growers, and crop advisors to create digital scouting reports in a very simple and intuitive way. The <b>geotagged reporting is voice-based</b> and does not require typing, allowing you to quickly identify <b>plant problems</b>, count insects, quantify <b>plant disease</b> and pest pressure, analyze pest traps, and record your insights while keeping your hands free. Reports are interactive and easily sharable, even outside the app.\r\n \r\nWe are excited by the possibilities that are opened up by transforming crop protection into a digitized domain. Join our community and let's make a difference together. We are looking forward to seeing you grow your plants to their full potential, improve your yield, and enjoy abundant harvests.",
