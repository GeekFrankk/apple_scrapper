      "review": "By far the best pregnancy app out there! The kick counter and contraction timers are GREAT. I adore the growing hand and foot images as well, so precious and it just helps the whole experience of pregnancy feel more real. I also really appreciate the anonymous community feature as well! On my of biggest frustrations with other apps is questions being ignored/unseen because I wasn’t a “top member.” I do have two other apps as well but each only serve one purpose. If Ovia would include these, they’d be a one stop shop far superior to the others! I use Pregnancy+ solely for the 3D realistic baby. It just helps me feel connected to my baby to know and what he might be looking like each weak. The other is app I use is The Bump. Similarly to Pregnancy+ there’s a more realistic visual. I love that I can see the baby in relation to my own body. It’s highly informative and helps keep my anxiety at bay. I also notice that The Bumps size comparisons seem to be a bit more in line with what I’ve seen online, though I do SO LOVE that you can change the theme of the size comparison with Ovia. Overall, Ovia is the #1 app I would (and do) recommend to all my expecting friends and family. more"

      "review": "This app definitely has a ton of useful features and is great for tracking a LOT of things. However, I really wish it would let you put in your own medications to track and also not just suggest 3 medications you regularly input. For instance, I take probiotics daily and there isn’t even an option for that (which is a common supplement), plus I take other supplements not listed. Let me input my own to record please. I also take more than 3 things every day but it only shows me 3 options and then I have to manually search for everything else every single day. Meanwhile it suggests like 6 of the top medicines people take all the time, but I don’t take any of those so they just take up space where I would rather see MY top 6. I also wish I could add multiple meds or symptoms without being spit back out to the data page after every single one. Let me select everything and then hit done so I don’t have to keep coming back into the symptom or med tracker and hitting search over and over. There are other minor annoyances with the UI too, one being that it often glitches and shows me the data tab at the bottom of the calendar screen even though I selected the notes tab. And when you try to view the trends graphs, you can’t zoom out to view the whole graph; you can only see like 2 dots on it at a time. Just feels like the app could use an upgrade and a slight UI makeover. more Thank you so much for taking the time to reach out and provide these thorough suggestions! We will be sure to share these with our team for consideration when making future updates. Please let us know if you have any other feedback or ideas for us at support@oviahealth.com. more"

      "review": "I’m nearly 18 weeks pregnant and have been using Ovia every day for months. When I first found out I was pregnant I installed five different pregnancy apps. Ovia quickly became my favorite because the health tracking is so flexible and intuitive. I’ve been tracking my sleep, weight, and symptoms, and ignore the parts I’m not interested in tracking (e.g. mood, nutrition, exercise). I also like that there’s a nice-length article each week and some daily content that isn’t too overwhelming. On the cons, sometimes the app takes a while to load, or to load the health tracking page. The daily questions of if I’m taking my prenatal vitamin got REALLY annoying really quickly, so now I just click “yes” on whatever question pops up when I first open the app to get past it quickly in the morning before I’ve forgotten my sleep hours. I think this has given the app some false data. My biggest qualm though is that I can’t seem to export my tracking data. I can’t believe this isn’t an option! The app only lets you graph a few variables over time (weight, sleep—though not your total sleep if you log multiple stints of sleep a night—activity, steps, blood pressure, and nutrition) and I am just itching to make my own graphs of some of my symptoms over time. The fact that it looks like I’m going to have to pull the data out manually is a HUGE bummer. I’m hoping this becomes part of the app in the near future. more"
