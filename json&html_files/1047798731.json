On the browsers, i also tried rotating my phone to landscape and the keyboard still doesn't appear. im on iOS 17.5.1. seems like a good app otherwise, i appreciate that i dont have to make an account with a password to use it more Hello, thank you for flagging this issue.

      "review": "I used to get awesome service through Nimble but I‚Äôm having so many issues with them recently that I‚Äôm beginning to wonder if the company is winding down/going out of business entirely. The most recent issue I had with them was that my medication was sent via USPS despite having gone through the checkout process for a courier delivery, as I had with all of my previous orders. My medication needs to remain temperature controlled and wasn‚Äôt at all ‚Äî it was delivered on a hot summer day several days later than the scheduled courier delivery date üòÖ. I‚Äôve been trying to get in touch with them via email for a couple of days now to find out whether they stopped offering the temperature controlled courier service but seem to be entirely unable to reach them. When emailing the support address, I got an automated email that my question would be responded to within 48 hours. Then today I got an email reply that their inbox is ‚Äúnot monitored.‚Äù This seemed odd, especially because the app still appears to be collecting payment and scheduling deliveries (presumably through the mail now?). I‚Äôve tried to reach them them through a few different email adddesses since there‚Äôs no phone number anywhere online or in the app. Not sure what‚Äôs going on with this app but it‚Äôs a shame because it was a great service! more Hello, we apologize for the inconvenience that you've experienced and we appreciate your feedback. We do recommend patients contact their pharmacy regarding courier related concerns as the pharmacy manages the prescription! We apologize for any issues with regards to contacting support. If you have additional concerns or feedback, you are welcome to contact us at feedback@nimblerx.com! Thank you kindly for your patience. more"

      "review": "I‚Äôve had three prescriptions sent to this pharmacy service. The only one that went through correctly or on time was the first one. I just got off a 30 minute chat with the web support team because my app shows ‚Äúrefill on schedule‚Äù for a medication that, according to the chat team, was never being processed by the pharmacy. I never received a notification or call that my medication wasn‚Äôt being processed and therefore wasn‚Äôt being ‚Äúrefilled on schedule.‚Äù Even now I cannot find anything on the website or the app showing that my medication actually isn‚Äôt being processed despite being available for refill now. I‚Äôm glad I realized it wasn‚Äôt being filled before I was completely out of my medication, too bad I only have one day left to find someone else to fill it. I will call my pharmacy tomorrow and get this sorted out, but it‚Äôs ridiculous and unsafe that I had to do this much digging to find that my medication wasn‚Äôt being filled. What if I was an elderly patient waiting on a more serious medication? They wouldn‚Äôt be able to navigate this confusing system to even realize they weren‚Äôt getting their medication before it was too late. more Hello, we apologize for the inconvenience that you are experiencing with your prescription order. We understand that this is a very frustrating experience. If you are still unable to resolve it with your pharmacy, please reach out to support@nimblerx.com again and we will help resolve your issue! more"
