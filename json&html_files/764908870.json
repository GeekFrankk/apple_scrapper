The calculator then displays insulin units/kg/day, carbohydrate-to-insulin ratio, insulin sensitivity (correction factor), fixed meal bolus dose, and daily basal dose. A calculator that converts hemoglobin A1C to the estimated corresponding average glucose value is also included as well as a converter of centimeters to inches together with a body mass index calculator. more",
