  "appDescription": "SkinCheck is a free triage tool to allow anyone to check their lesions for skin cancer*, track their lesions over time, and compare their lesions to an index of different cancerous and non-cancerous lesion types. * Skin lesion image analysis limited in the U.S. and select regions. According to the Skin Cancer Foundation, two people die every hour from skin-cancer in the U.S. alone. The hope for my app is to bring down this alarming statistic by letting users know if their moles are concerning and recommending them to seek treatment. Disclaimer: SkinCheck app does not provide medical advice, diagnosis or treatment. The assessments provided are heavily dependent on the quality of the image. If you have any concerns you should see a certified doctor.

      "review": "I introduced this app to one of my teachers he was a bit unconvinced but then decided to try it. The results came out as skin cancer, he of course didn’t believe it so he went to get it checked out, and it turned out to be true. He got it removed before it got any worse, I am thankful we caught it early. This app is like my hero. Thank you. more"
