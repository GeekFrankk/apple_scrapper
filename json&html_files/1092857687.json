  "appDescription": "Easy access to scoring systems relevant to UK emergency medicine practice. The key scoring systems at your finger-tips. Never again will you get half way through an AMT and forget the questions! Knowing the score is only half the answer! Where applicable, each scoring system is linked to relevant national guidance such as that from NICE. The user interface has been designed to be used at the point-of-care, keeping data entry to a minimum and alerting you as soon as you reach the threshold value of the decision rule. This now includes haptic feedback on supported devices. Conversions by default. Just because a rule needs your patient's weight in kilograms it doesn’t mean they will know it. Every height and weight field accepts imperial or metric values and converts them for you. The list of rules displayed can be edited so that you only see the rules you need and can display your most used items first. All hidden rules remain searchable in case you need them. See our website for a full list of included content or to suggest a rule for inclusion. more",
