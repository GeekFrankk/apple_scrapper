      "review": "This freestyle Libre 3 app doesn‚Äôt have the feature control switch listed in the section to control background refresh‚Ä¶ not sure that‚Äôs why it continually loses signal and I have to leave the app open and active of my device to Not loose the signal. But it is suspicious! AND‚Ä¶ Really missing not being able to use Apple Watch stand alone‚Ä¶ without rigging all the other apps to get the info on my watch‚Ä¶ perhaps you are familiar‚Ä¶the option that requires you to Still carry your phone everywhere‚Ä¶and rely on three other apps(two additional companies) to feed the data to your watch‚Ä¶Doh!!! BUT‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs NOW BROKEN even more‚Ä¶ Now it‚Äôs worse, because with the app is constantly losing signal‚Ä¶ it just breaks all the apps connected to it‚Ä¶ signal loss alarms a blazing‚Ä¶ annoying as ever and eating at my battery‚Ä¶ regardless‚Ä¶ because I have to keep my phone screen active and on‚Ä¶ not to mention the awkward privacy concerns of having to always having the app open and HUGE displayed on my phone for everyone to see! I would delete and reinstall the app‚Ä¶ but I don‚Äôt believe there is a way to reconnect the sensor I‚Äôve already started üò© Otherwise the tech is brilliant and it‚Äôs really super amazing and helpful to know your numbers without constantly dealing with bulk of a bag, the poking, and the endless sanitizing and cleanup‚Ä¶ Abbott, please go that last mile to make this product 5 stars please!!! more Thank you for your comment.

      "title": "An amazing tool, but app needs work\n\n    Developer Response",
      "review": "I want to begin with my critique of the app. The critical alarm needs to be customizable. It is an ear-piercing alarm that you cannot adjust the volume of. Please allow for different volumes and allow for vibration alerts too. I understand that it‚Äôs a liability if the alarm isn‚Äôt heard, but the fact that there‚Äôs no way to lower the volume makes me uncomfortable with using it at work/in class. I can‚Äôt have this beeping when I‚Äôm attending a lecture or taking an exam. This really needs to be changed in order for diabetics to make this part of their daily life. This is my only critique as if 14 days of use. It is an amazing tool that relieves stress immensely. After 20 years of pricking my finger, it‚Äôs incredible to not constantly have to use traditional meter testing. While I still do use my meter everyday, the frequency with which I test is down by about 60%. Before Libre 3, I tested 12X a day. Now it‚Äôs around 5X. Also, the comfort of having truly accurate sensor readings upon simply opening my app is life changing. Thank you for giving diabetics some sense of normalcy and a break from the relentless guessing game of blood sugars. Even with proper management, some things just can‚Äôt be controlled. The Libre 3 has eased some anxieties and given me comfort I never thought I would have. Just please fix the alarm system. I want to enjoy this 24/7, not just when I am comfortable with a loud alarm going off in the privacy of my own home. more Thank you for your comment.

      "title": "Can‚Äôt turn off alarms. Inaccurately wakes me up all night.\n\n    Developer Response",
      "review": "Update. After using for six weeks the third sensor ended in the middle of the night, cutting out about three hours of use, based on when I applied the last, and then the app froze on ‚Äúyou must be an adult‚Äù. After applying a new sensor, the app remained frozen. Tried turning on and off my phone. That didn‚Äôt help. I had to uninstall the app and reinstall, losing all my history data. Here‚Äôs my original review. No changes since my review: You can‚Äôt turn off certain alarms in this version, so the app keeps waking me up. The problem is I‚Äôm a side sleeper so the sensor regularly loses connectivity or senses an inaccurate low reading. I have resorted to turning off my Bluetooth in order to get any sleep. When turning on my Bluetooth in the morning it won‚Äôt connect unless I reopen the app and wait three minutes. Thankfully, the sensor seems to have some built in memory, so it generally charts my nighttime numbers once I reconnect. I also dislike the fact that I can no longer take an immediate reading. It‚Äôs nice that the app reads the sensor every few minutes, but sometime you need to know right away and don‚Äôt have the luxury of staring at your phone for a few minutes in order to get a current reading. Fix these few things and it will be a great app. Not sure what can be done about the inaccurate readings when sleeping on my side, but I can live with that since I‚Äôm pretty consistent with my night numbers. more We'd like to follow up with this.
