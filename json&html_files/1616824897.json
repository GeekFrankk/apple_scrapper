      "review": "I have a 6 month old that never slept in any of the months of her life, when she hit the four months “regression,” I was already so sleep deprived it felt no different. I was angry, frustrated and at the end of my rope. My husband and I work 24-hour shifts, I’m also a full-time paramedic student and finishing degrees, so operating on no sleep and then trying to make it through the day, just to come home again and not sleep was so defeating. Our baby was up every hour, and wouldn’t go down until almost 3-4am EVERY night. Around 4 months old, I found this app and for the first time she started to slept through the night or at least in 4-5 hour stretches. When I tell you I had tried EVERYTHING, I had tried everything. Routines, sleeping time lotions, natural remedies, different bed times etc, this was the only thing that actually worked for us. I figured we had it down now and I could delete the app, WRONG lol… we slowly regressed back to original state. I redownloaded the app 2 days ago, and last night she slept from 12a-7a. Tonight she’s been asleep from from 8:30p-now, with ZERO wake-up’s. I thank this app for reinstating my sanity and making me such a happier mom. If you’re like me and just not sure how to proceed, PLEASE give this app a try. more"

      "review": "I am not and have never been a good sleeper. I know I want my son to have a fighting chance but what we were doing prior to this app was a little chaotic. This app gives me a template of how my day may go and helps me plan better and make a routine for my almost 8 month old. Before it I was very overwhelmed. It’s been only a week and I have seen such an improvement in the way he falls and stays asleep. I used to laugh at the “drowsy but awake” mantra and now I’m living it. There is so much more consistency in his sleep. We are working on staying asleep past 5am, but the improvements I’ve seen have given me the confidence in both myself and my son to push through and stay consistent as well and start to work on nap time and conquering these contact naps. This app may not work for everyone immediately but I think it’s worth a try. The price is fair to me and I’m surprised a lot of people said it was too high. This is more than a sleep tracking app despite what other reviews say. There’s a little more help involved and the positive messages, tips, and lessons help me so much. At least take advantage of the free trial! Good luck, parents! more Thank you so much for taking the time to leave us this awesome review! We work so hard to help parents get more sleep and reviews like this make it all worthwhile! Wishing you lots more sleep in the future! ~Mandy, Pediatric Sleep Consultant more"

      "review": "I wanted to like this app so much but since using it I've come across many issues. After completing several of the courses I find out I can't access my baby's sleep plan until he's 12 weeks old (he's only 6 weeks). So now I've paid for a 3 month subscription and can only use it for its intended use for a portion of that time. The other really annoying issue is the internal timer when recording a nursing session. On many occasions in there middle of using the timer, I've exited the app only to come back and see that the timer has reset itself back to zero so I have no idea how long I've been nursing for. Tonight when doing a night feeding the timer wouldn't even start at all so I had to manually input the feeding session. What's the point of this timer function if it doesn't even work properly half the time?!?! I gave this app one star because I like that I can track my baby's naps and wake windows which I find very helpful however the smart AI tool has issues as well when adjusting his schedule. I track all of his naps including any wake ups he has during the naps. The AI continues to suggest a 5th nap every day around 5pm which my baby refuses no matter how many times I try and doesn't readjust the schedule!! So dumb and definitely not worth a paid subscription for how expensive this app is. Also most of the information in the courses is stuff I already knew just from reading on google which is free. Waste of money. more"
