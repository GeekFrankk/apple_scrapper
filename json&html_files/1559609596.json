      "review": "I have been using the app since the beginning of 2021. They have continually improved and updated since then and the updates have been helpful and the additional resources included in the app, such as messaging your actual, personal, local, medical providers and getting real-time responses in my experience on average 10 minutes or less. This is huge in helping veterans with social isolation or suicidal ideations and PTSD and other disabilities schedule appointments and reach out for care without physically talking to someone on the phone, but still being able to reach a VA employee who can schedule all the care needed on a case by case basis and tailor it to your personal needs. Since the amount of time a claim requires for processing from beginning to end is average 3-6 months they should consider upgrading to an even more in-depth system to show the veteran where they are in the process exactly without any assuming involved, the veterans next actions/steps to be done exactly, and a ballpark/estimated completion date would go a long way in improving the attitude of veterans towards the VA claims process. I believe it would eliminate some if not all of the uncertainty around the length of time the claim will be, and the feeling that the claim is not being handled or being given the attention it deserves, both would considerably reduce the amount of phone calls received daily pertaining to claims and status. üá∫üá∏FYea more"

      "review": "As someone who frequently uses the VA website for disability claims and healthcare, this is a huge timesaver. I read in another review that there might soon be notifications of medical appointment changes. This would be huge since I‚Äôm usually not told when an appointment changes or gets cancelled. The only improvement I would like to see is an ability to refresh the status of a disability claim. For instance it is 4:30 in the afternoon now but it is showing my most recent status from when I checked it at 10pm yesterday. It seems you can only check it once per 24 hours with the app. This is fine most of the time but when they are getting close to publishing a final decision, I‚Äôd like to refresh more often. As it stands, this is now pushing me back to the website daily. more"

      "review": "Logging in and out of this app is very inefficient. I have Face ID setting turned on, yet every time I log in, there are probably six or seven screens to navigate through just to get in, including ‚Äúwaiting to redirect‚Äù and needing to text authentication codes every time. And when you log out, there are 4 pages and prompts to get through just to leave. The messaging system needs some work too. It only shows a portion of sent messages, and when you click the down arrow to expand the window, it still won‚Äôt show you the full message. And for writing new messages, the main message box is irritating at best. Accidentally touching outside of the box makes the text go gray, and the screen jump up and down. The cursor is like a sick joke being played on me, and most of the ‚Äúcontinue‚Äù buttons need to be pressed at least two or three times to activate. I downloaded the app because it‚Äôs supposed to be simpler than using the website, but that doesn‚Äôt seem to be the reality. And considering that a lot of us veterans are suffering from PTSD and high anxiety, I would hope that the developers could create an app that doesn‚Äôt give me a near panic attack every time I need to use it. Do better, please. more"
