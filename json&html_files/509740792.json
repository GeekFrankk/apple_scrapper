      "review": "I really love this app! I‚Äôve been looking for an app that goes over surgical procedures and lets you do some stuff during the surgery. I specifically like neurosurgery and I‚Äôm glad that this app has a lot of procedures for it. There‚Äôs so much to choose from such as cardiothoracic and general surgery. What I also like about this app is how realistic the videos are and how there is a learning process and a test to see what you remember as you perform the surgery. I like how it goes over medical terms as you go through the surgical procedures step by step because it broadens your knowledge of Anatomy terms. I‚Äôm not a doctor, but this app gave me a better insight of what kind of surgeon I specifically want to be in the future. It made me want to be a neurosurgeon even more! more"

      "review": "I am in no way a medical professional but I really want to be and this is the perfect app for an aspiring surgeon or med student. Very detailed and descriptive. Things I might suggest for developers would be adding more surgeries to specific specialities because some have very few. As well as possibly adding something like a dictionary for beginners (as things like google are not always reliable). And offline support would also be really handy for me and lots of other people. Overall best surgical app I‚Äôve used. It‚Äôs good to strike down boredom with something that‚Äôs actually fulfilling. 10/10 would recommend this game!! üëç more"

      "review": "I am a 3rd year IM resident who loves procedures and crit care. This app is by far the best app I‚Äôve ever come across throughout my education‚Ä¶ ever‚Ä¶ from undergrad until now. Every time of resident, med student, and fellow could use this app (and attendings needing refreshers). Great for PAs/NPs who do a lot of procedures or ones in school. It has something for every specialty too, step by step, with 3D moving images to facilitate better recall and understanding. I make all my interns download this and watch the video before discussing with them and before letting them do one. more"
