      "review": "Hinge Health is an excellent resource available to take care of yourself and make a difference in your health and longevity. My doctor was talking surgery. To me, surgery is a last resort. Insurance provided the opportunity to participate in Hinge Health physical therapy as a starting alternative. Knowing that physical therapy can make a huge difference I signed up. Hinge Health provided an excellent solution and I can participate fully right here at home. HH provided targeted physical therapy in an easy to follow format that allows me work at my own pace while strengthening and rebuilding weak areas. With HH, I have eliminated 95% of the pain associated with my condition and am becoming stronger daily, thus nullifying some of the underlying factors that contributed to my initial problem. Building up your strength slowly, with the help of your coach and the exercises customized to your needs can make all the difference long term. HH provides everything you need including your own online coach to cheer you on and monitor your progress. I have been using this program, sometimes not as much as I should, and recently realized that I have achieved some core strengths and abilities that I have never been able to do, even when I was younger and in top shape. Challenge yourself and give yourself the gift of targeted, loving care. The work you put in is worth every minute. The pay off is a stronger you. Maybe even stronger than ever! more Hi Data123654, Thank you so much for taking the time to share your experience in such great detail! We are thrilled to hear that you eliminated 95% of the pain associated with your condition. Your review is extremely valuable and keeps us striving to always go above and beyond with our program offerings. We are grateful to partner with you on your wellness journey.

      "review": "Iâ€™m very thankful my insurance offers this program for it saves time and money while being very effective. I have used it first for pain in my neck and then the specific pelvic floor health program. I like the access to both a therapist who you can have telehealth appointments with to discuss individualizing your plan and a health coach to check in and encourage. I have had significant improvement in both programs and continue to feel much better and stronger. I can stick with doing my exercises weekly for I can do them on my own time and at home. The videos they provide are great and the articles are very helpful and informative. I tell all my doctors about this program and how itâ€™s helped me. I used to have urinary frequency and urgency and pudendal nerve pain affecting me when sitting. Where I used to have to go to the bathroom every hour each morning, with the urgency being painful, I can go three hours in between and the signal to go is not painful. The nerve pain that would flare during sitting periods has greatly reduced and I have easy stretches throughout the workday to do to help. Many days Iâ€™m not bothered by it even with long days at the computer. I know all my improvements have been from doing this pelvic floor exercise program that I have completed and I will continue weekly to do the exercises to maintain. more We are thrilled to hear about the positive impact our program has had on your health and well-being. Your dedication to the exercises and the support from our physical therapists and health coaches are key elements to your success. Thank you for sharing your experience with your doctors, we appreciate your kind words! Sincerely, Jess from Hinge Health Support more"

      "review": "I had done PT for a torn meniscus and realized that I had to keep the work going after PT ended to maintain my progress. I was struggling to be consistent on my own and identify new exercises that progressing with my improvements. I was falling off and my pain level increased. I was frustrated and demoralized. I took advantage of the app provided through my insurance. Through consistency I am back to longer walks, biking, dance sessions and more! The education passages at the end of each session have been so helpful particularly when I had a flare up. Iâ€™ve had flare upâ€™s thats been attributed to arthritis (Uncle Arthur has been uninvited from the family reunion ðŸ˜‚) and this practice continues to provide benefits! I regularly go to the gym and workout in my own now AND I still find it invaluable to keep up this practice as my PT continues to modify my exercises to continue to strengthen the chain. I remember when I didnâ€™t think I would ever walk with out pain, stand up with ease, or even get up off the floor again! Combining the app workouts with regular activity and exercise, puts me well on my way to pay personal goal of dancing and performing for hours again. It has been a journey to get back to the active lifestyle Iâ€™ve always wanted and my body craves! You can do this too! more Thank you for sharing your experience with us! We're thrilled to hear that our app has helped you stay consistent with your exercise routine and manage your pain levels. It's inspiring to see how far you've come and we're here to support you on your journey to an active lifestyle. Keep up the great work! Best, Jess from Hinge Health Support more"
