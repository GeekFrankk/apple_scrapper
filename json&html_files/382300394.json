      "review": "This is the provider I am forced to use so I do what I can. There are no CVS pharmacies within reasonable driving distance so I am stuck with the online site. It is difficult to manage the auto refill and auto renew features. It seems like they MAKE it hard so they can send medications that you don‚Äôt need any more, at that point, they can FORCE YOU to pay for it since they say they can‚Äôt accept returns. I feel 3 stars is very generous. I wouldn‚Äôt doubt there customer base would shrink by a lot if employers offered choices of prescription plans. CVS needs better clarity for their web site and phone apps. AND THEY NEED TO ALLOW US TO GO TO A LOCAL PHARMACY FOR MAINTENANCE MEDS WHEN THEY DON‚ÄôT HAVE A STORE LOCALLY. more"

      "review": "This really is the worst app. If you don‚Äôt have high blood pressure before using it you definitely will after. But don‚Äôt get excited- they won‚Äôt let you refill your BP meds- because of course they know better than your Dr. there is nothing simple about this app. Tell it to use facial recognition- go ahead. But it will still ask for a password that it will refuse to recognize. Want to refill a prescription? Nope! Not gonna do that even though it was last refilled 3 months ago. I am convinced they make it impossible to use so that you need more meds that the app will refuse to give you even though a medical professional prescribed them. I really really hate this app and I am forced to use it because of course. Insurance. For meds that aren‚Äôt even addictive like for BP or cholesterol. This app will completely ruin a perfectly good evening. This app will tell you to renew a med and you‚Äôll do it then it will chastise you and say it‚Äôs too soon. This app makes you think hmmm I‚Äôd rather die than try to use it to refill a prescription. more"

      "review": "I was mistakenly told to download this by a customer service rep. To speak to a person is nearly IMPOSSIBLE. The representative that I called to help me troubleshoot says their system shuts down 5 times a day. It took 20 minutes for him to tell me to just call my insurance. His supervisor couldn‚Äôt even help. I insisted there was some confusion and I may not be in the right department. He said CVS could not help, call my insurance. These people are horrible, I can not imagine an elderly person dealing with themüò¢. He laughed and said he couldn‚Äôt help and said I live in a ‚ÄúCoronavirus Area‚Äù ??? California ???The app constantly froze and he said I didn‚Äôt exist in the entire CVS system(actually a ten year member). People please be careful with your loved ones. He asked for a lot of personal information only to say to call someone else. The app didn‚Äôt help and just shut down when it experienced an error, in addition to taking multiple minutes to load. They clearly don‚Äôt have the infrastructure or training in this department or app. 100% DO NOT RECOMMEND. more"
