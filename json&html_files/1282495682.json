  "appDescription": "For women under the care of North Bristol NHS Trust Community Midwives or are having their baby at Cossham or Mendip Birth Centre or Southmead Central Delivery Suite. The My Pregnancy @ North Bristol NHS Trust App, funded by Southmead Hospital Charity, is a free to use App designed for women who are under the care of North Bristol NHS Trust Community Midwives or are planning on having their baby at Cossham Birth Centre, Mendip Birth Centre or the Central Delivery Suite. Easy to use anytime, anywhere, it provides lots of information about pregnancy, labour and post-birth, and helps parents-to-be make informed choices about where they want to give birth. Once downloaded the app does not require an internet connection. It replaces leaflets, which are often lost – though paper copies will still be available on request. The content has been produced by our experienced midwives and clinicians. The information included within the app is also available on our website www.nbt.nhs.uk/maternity The App will be regularly reviewed to ensure it contains the most up-to-date information possible so please ensure you have the most recent version updated on your device(s). The information included in the App may not be relevant to all pregnant women, as it covers many conditions during pregnancy, labour and birth. If you have any questions, please ask one of our midwives. If you have any comments regarding the app, please email website@nbt.nhs.uk more",
