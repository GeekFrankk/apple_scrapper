  "appDescription": "Cardiac Trials is an educational tool that aggregates landmark clinical trials within cardiology at your fingertips. The hallmark of Cardiac Trials is its organization: the application organizes clinical trials by discipline and furthermore by subject matter within each discipline, allowing quick access to bite-sized morsels of practice-changing clinical trials within seconds. Cardiac Trials is a must-have for clinicians in-training: fellows, residents, students, but can be used and studied at any level. Constantly updated, Cardiac Trials strives to reflect both historical and the most up-to-date clinical trials published to date within the field of cardiology. more",

      "review": "Such a thorough and up to date resource to quickly find evidence based data so well organized and accessible immediately. I have been in medical practice for over 30 years and have relied on periodically reading articles, attending CME courses to stay current but with the large amount of data and trials it is difficult to be keep up. When in doubt I further have to further research the particular topic. This brings it all together in a very well organized format with both landmark historical as well as the most up-to-date trials. Not only is this app going to be a timesaver but knowing that you can have access to this valuable data at your fingertips will add additional level of confidence when making critical medical decisions. All clinicians in training or in practice can benefit greatly by including this app in their armamentarium. more"
