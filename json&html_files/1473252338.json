      "review": "I really tried to do this test last night, the finger monitor was so tight on my finger that it actually hurt and kept waking me up, I tried to put it on different finger within just a few minutes I had indentation on the other finger to. So I waited for awhile without it on put it back on maybe slept for an hour and woke up hurting again so I don‚Äôt even know if this worked for me but I‚Äôm not going to try it again if it didn‚Äôt bc I took photos of both fingers and will show and speak with my doctor about it. Wish everyone luck that it doesn‚Äôt happen to you as well. more"

      "review": "Test was transmitted without a hitch. Attaching the sensors was easy. Pairing the device went flawlessly. Not really sure what all the negative reviews are about. I didn‚Äôt have a single issue. No discomfort. I just followed the instructions which were clear and easy to follow. üíÅüèº I checked in with Lofta to make sure everything got to them as I‚Äôve read several reviews the test information did not send. They received it without issue. I got my test results from a sleep doctor in less than 12 hours and a full personalized recommendation. It was easy to understand. I requested my prescription and it was password protected and emailed to me, again within 12 hours. I really can‚Äôt speak enough to the level of care I‚Äôve received. A few tips. If you follow the instructions to the letter, you won‚Äôt have any issues. Go step by step. If at any point the device isn‚Äôt working, contact Lofta. Their customer service is awesome. Be patient with the technology. Make sure it‚Äôs connected (green light) and that the watch is not too tight. Attach the sensor on your chest with some medical tape. Don‚Äôt put the finger with the sensor over your head or higher than your heart and you won‚Äôt have discomfort/throbbing. Be patient. Relax. more"

      "review": "This has been a bank saver and what I mean by that is I didn‚Äôt have to go spend 1,000 to 5,000 taking the sleep test. I‚Äôve seen a lot of bad reviews, far as their finger being sore (unbearably). As a 6 foot 300 pound man with bigger than normal fingers, I did not have the same experience as most. Am not telling you your finger won‚Äôt be a little sore when you take it off, it was sore for maybe 45 minutes but it was nothing to get on here and write a bad review about it. After taking the test, my results were in and I had an appointment scheduled the next day to talk with someone. If you or someone that can follow directions fairly well this test is for you. If you take it upon yourself thinking you know best with every situation, you should probably go and see a specialist. Best thousand of dollars I‚Äôve saved yet! more"
