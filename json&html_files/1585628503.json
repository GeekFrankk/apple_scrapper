      "review": "So what‚Äôs the point of this app anyway???? In previous years I was able to see benefits, coverage, if my spouse was still covered, track claims, etc. Got a claim letter in the mail that doesn‚Äôt look right so I go to my trusty Delta app and I‚Äôm told the app has been retired and I need to download the new version. Done! Open it and there is NO benefits info, no info about dependents and no info on my current claim!!! I try looking in the ‚Äúmore‚Äù section and an alert comes up that the info I am looking for ‚Äúwill be available in 2022‚Ä¶..um it‚Äôs January 2022 right now so why is this not available???? DO NOT waste your time even Spaniard if this app it is useless and now you will NOT have access to your delta info. Unacceptable! How are you supposed to manage your insurance this way. Additionally trying to post this review and every ‚Äúnickname‚Äù I choose supposedly has been taken!! more"

      "review": "I was walking the dog after a dental procedure and wanted to check in on my Delta dental benefits. I tried loading the website, but the member portal is so bloated and Janky. It just wouldn‚Äôt open on my phone on 5G so I figured I‚Äôd give the app a shot because I figured it was a lot of client library loading that was causing problems. After downloading the app and logging in it worked perfectly. I could see my benefits and authenticate and even offered to set up Face ID. So the app worked very well and had all the info I was hoping to get. I would give the member portal zero stars, however. I don‚Äôt know what needs to be done, but the page load is monstrous and needs to be optimized. Also, during authentication, I got to see the actual name of the auth provider something something ‚Äì prod. That felt a little janky and didn‚Äôt feel like something the user should see but I‚Äôm glad it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äì dev or ‚Äì stage üòì more"

      "review": "When I login it says unable to retrieve account details and directs me to contact their customer service. Their customer service states they do not provide technical support for the Mobile App. Then what is the point of saying to contact customer service?!? I cannot access my insurance information to give to providers using the web browser on my phone. I don‚Äôt typically take my laptop with me to the dentist, but guess I‚Äôll have to so I can access my insurance information that i pay for. I don‚Äôt think I will continue to use this insurance provider in the future as it‚Äôs a pain to access your information and they do not provide physical cards. Absolutely ridiculous!!! A poor excuse for an app and a company. more Hi!
