      "review": "This is an amazing app! I paid $37 for the student version and it is perfect. I am lucky to be in a class where we have cadavers but I can‚Äôt always go to open lab. So this very useful for visualizing the ligaments and muscles. I love the search feature and being able to add muscles one at a time to the skeleton. I also like that you can hide certain muscles to see those that are deep. The AR feature is great for sketching and the lectures are helpful as well. If you‚Äôre in an online anatomy class especially or without access to cadavers this is your best friend and absolutely worth the price. My only critique is that I would love to be able to save certain skeletons that I build. For example after I add all the muscles that move the pectoral girdle to the skeleton I would love to be able to save it to come back to later. And be able to make ‚Äúplaylists‚Äù of all my saved models so that they‚Äôre easy to find. It‚Äôs possible I just haven‚Äôt figured this out yet too, still learning the app a little bit. more Hello, Ahmed Ammar. Thank you for taking the time leaving us with a 5-star review. We will forward your suggestion to our Development for further review. Please contact our Support Team via https://service.elsevier.com/app/contact/ if you need assistance.

      "title": "Keeps Crashing\n\n    Developer Response",
      "review": "I‚Äôve never paid for an app before but I‚Äôm in school to become a Registered Diagnostic Sonographer and I needed something a bit more in-depth, yet, basically ‚Äúdummy proof‚Äù in explaining blood vessel connections and course. If it can help all of these med students then surely it could help me. I wasn‚Äôt expecting this app to do that and so much more. Honestly the best $37 ever spent. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm memorizing things either; when I gain an understanding of something then it sticks in my head so much better. With my textbooks and class lectures, I‚Äôve just been flash carding everything in my head because alot of the information feels like disjointed information. With this app I feel like relevances has been introduced for the first time. I gave it three stars for one reason only: it keeps crashing. Again, I‚Äôm in school for sonography so being able to locate organs from the transverse view is important. I select the cross-section option in order to see the body habitus transversely and the app closes out completely every time. It worked at first - I only discovered the cross-sectional view this morning but now at 5:30 in the evening it no longer works. An incredible bummer because this app is actually the only reason I now understand what my textbooks have been showing me from that specific view. I honestly don‚Äôt need to make full use of all of the apps capabilities; the few things I do use it for are now only 50% operative. Please fix the crashing üôèüèº more Hello and thank you for your review as well as your in-depth feedback. This sounds like it could be a corrupted download. Please reinstall the app from the App Store. That should solve your problem. If the issue persists however, please contact our Support team directly. https://3d4medical.com/contact.

      "review": "This really is the most comprehensive Anatomy App today. Not only does it include every structure, but it also shows all the forms of movement for every muscle, insertion and origin points and even full courses from experts. That said, the developers need to improve their female Anatomy represetation. Right now you can only see female torso and pelvis. The entire female structure is different than the male, would be great to incide both. Additionally they need to include different skin color options, because diseases present differently on different skin tones. And it's just more inclusive. Make those changes and it would be perfect. Edit: They responded to my question and will have the full female anatomy represented in Winter 2021! Once again the BEST anatomy app. The remaining change for them to make is to add various skin tones to understand how disease presents differently. I'm sure that'll be a quick & easy addition. Thanks developer team! more Hello, thank you for your feedback. We are very much concerned about the lack of a full female model. That is why we have developed the most accurate, most detailed female pelvis and female thorax on the market. We are striving to generate a true representation of the female anatomy and not merely a feminized version of the male anatomy as is currently most common in the 3D anatomy market. We hope to release a full female model in the Winter of 2021. Thank you. - 3D4Medical. more"
