      "review": "I am currently in a&p and these quizzes are helping me memorize the names of the bones. So helpful! The only thing I would say it’s not worth the money each month. There are other apps that are free that are just like this one. Also I don’t like the colors on the bones it confuses me at times. more"

      "review": "It’s kind of helpful looking at the 3D model to study the bones and landmarks but it doesn’t show all of the ones I need to know and it uses different names for some of them. I don’t think it’s worth the money. I did the yearly subscription which showed that I could pay 8 dollars per month which would total yo about 100 dollars a year. I was just charged 100 dollars outright instead of 8 dollars a month. This is really upsetting because I feel as tho I have been misinformed with my subscription and I am a college student who does not have to finances to pay that outright. There are other apps that will be more worth your time that are free. more Thank you for sharing your feedback with us. We’re sorry to hear that your experience hasn’t fully met your expectations, and we’d like to address your concerns. First, regarding the 3D models, we take great pride in offering one of the most detailed and anatomically accurate models available, especially when compared to free alternatives. Our team of experts works hard to ensure that the models are comprehensive and precise, but we understand that there may be certain terms or landmarks that differ from what you're used to. If you could provide specific examples, we’d be happy to address this and improve your learning experience further. Regarding the subscription charge, we understand how frustrating this can be. Our yearly subscription is set up to offer a discounted rate for the full year, which is why it’s billed upfront at $100 rather than in monthly installments. We apologize if this wasn’t clear during the purchase process. As a college student, we want to ensure that Easy Anatomy remains accessible to you, and we'd be happy to look into possible solutions, such as adjusting your plan or issuing a partial refund. Please don’t hesitate to reach out so we can resolve this issue and ensure Easy Anatomy continues to support your studies effectively. We truly value your business and your feedback. Best regards, The Easy Anatomy Team more"
