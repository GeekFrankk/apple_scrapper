      "review": "I switched to Ovia after my previous phone had to be restored. And ever since then I have loved Ovia. Overall I think it’s the neatest and easiest way to track anything your body is going through. My only complaint is that when it predicts the day your period is supposed to start and your period doesn’t come, I nit that it didn’t start that specific day and the day predicted for it to start changes right away to the next day. I wish the predictions would still show on the calendar while actually pinning down the days that it actually started along with the days that it was supposed to based on your previous trends. Besides that, I would highly recommend it! All the features such as adding in your symptoms, how you’ve been feeling, and the question/answer section is absolutely helpful when you are wanting to know about something! Asking users who also use Ovia and most likely have gone through what you’re going through has helped me answer questions about whether what I was going through was normal or something I should be worried about. And I also love the fact that when you conceive the app switches over to one that you can use while pregnant and after while knowing and keeping track of your past activities. I would choose Ovia if you’re needing an app like it! more"

      "review": "I started using the Ovia Fertility app initially to track my periods and get a sense of my cycle before my husband and I were ready to TTC (I had a copper IUD so I wanted to be able to track the changes once it was removed). As a period tracker and as a fertility tracker once we were TTC it was super useful for the most part. I agree with other reviewers that I would some way (other than me writing it in as note) to mark when I’m late for an expected period instead of the app just resetting the cycle count. Overall I’m happy with the app when I’m TTC and I loved the sister pregnancy app. Unfortunately, I’ve had two miscarriages and neither app does a good job in handling those. With my first one, I ended up having to mark it as a “period” to track the bleeding and stop the app from telling me to take a pregnancy test. After we got the second positive test, I found out the pregnancy app hadn’t updated itself from the first loss. It was an emotional sucker punch to log in and be told that I was only a couple of weeks away from my original due date. With this second loss, and again despite informing the apps of the miscarriage, nothing has changed in my fertility app. I don’t want to mark it as a period but the app now has me on some crazy cycle day. I don’t want to reset everything and lose all the data but it needs to have a system in place to track these without creating huge outlier cycles... more"

      "review": "Updated review: The developer reached out and their suggestion fixed my issue. I appreciate it when there is support for bugs like the one I was having, and the team makes an effort to help their users. I’m glad to know that if I get a new phone or have to uninstall the app to fix a problem in the future that my data is saved on their servers...not knowing that was the only reason I hadn’t tried uninstalling/reinstalling already (nobody wants to lose all their data). This app really is wonderful, and I’m glad I can use it again! Old review (crashing issue): I loved this app...when it worked. It now crashes nearly every time I attempt to open it. It’s really frustrating to have everything I’ve logged trapped in an app I can no longer use. I would happily give it 5 stars if I could open it consistently because I felt like it was one of the most comprehensive fertility apps I’ve used, and I’ve tried several over the years. Please fix this issue, so I can at least access my data. I’d love to use this app again if it starts working! more So happy to hear everything is working and thank you for being an Ovia user!! more"
