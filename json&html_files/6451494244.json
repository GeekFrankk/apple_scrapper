      "review": "So I have been an EMS Educator for nearly 15 years and I’ve always found getting people to retain the math needed to figure correct Tidal Volumes. There’s always the “guess” method which is both dangerous and foolish. This app makes a lot of that stress disappear! I love it and I’ve recommended this app to everyone. THE DEVELOPER DID AN EXCELLENT JOB!!! more"
