      "review": "I took my almost 2 year old here this past weekend for a head injury. After hitting his head on the wall and actually breaking through the drywall, my toddler was a bit wobbly. His regular pediatrician office was closed but they told me over the phone to take him to urgent care asap to get him looked at for possible concussion. This was our first time visiting this office, I really loved the environment and all the colorful walls and cute designs. It definitely made my toddler feel comfortable. The staff was very helpful and friendly during check in and filling in paper work since it was our first time. The doctor was really nice and my son was comfortable with him. The visit overall was the fastest visit I have ever had! My son is totally fine. But I will be honest, after reading several reviews, I do wish the doctor would‚Äôve taken a little more time checking my son for a possible concussion. I‚Äôm not a doctor so I will be honest, I don‚Äôt really know what to check for, but all he did was check his eyes with a little light. Is that enough?? I‚Äôm not sure. I did ask a few questions, and the doctor answered all my questions politely. We will be coming back here for emergency visits. Hopefully the doctor takes his time when needed :) but no complaints here! :) more"

      "review": "I don‚Äôt even know where to begin! Solv is quite literally the answer to my doctors office avoiding prayers. I woke up a few days ago, figured I had a sinus infection brewing but decided eh, you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about. Just ignore it. Saturday morning rolls around, Come to find out, I knew what I was talking about. Pounding headache, sinus pain, can‚Äôt swallow. I was a mess, after sleeping the day away, I woke up at 530 and was sure I was screwed. When I remembered Solv! I logged in and there was an appointment available 12 minutes later. I signed a virtual form, verified my info and then saw the angel of a provider who listened to my symptoms agreed I had a sinus infection and sent me a script for antibiotics and a few other feel better meds! I was able to wake up schedule visit and pick up my script within 36 minutes. On a Saturday evening. I‚Äôm a longtime doctors office avoider, so the fact that everything was so simple and so easy was fantastic. Not having to leave my bed except to get my meds was even better. For anybody who doubts telemedicine or it‚Äôs abilities let me tell you‚Ä¶.Solv is the way of the future, don‚Äôt knock it til you try it!! 5 stars all the way, thanks again Solv! more"

      "review": "Solv made all the difference in the way I will now view making a Urgent Care visit in the future! Booking an appointment that day and not having to take a blind guess on when‚Äôs gonna be the best time with the shortest wait time to drop in cause you dread how your irritable 3 year old is going to get through a potentially less than desirable long wait time, and then I wonder how I‚Äôm gonna make it dealing with him! I‚Äôm SOOO grateful to have made my appointment earlier that day. I have already been a huge fan of the Woodcreek family, but it just got so much better thanks to Solv! Knowing now that I can go online, book an Urgent Care appointment (if I can‚Äôt get an appointment with anyone that day and it‚Äôs not a life threatening emergency), and that they honestly will honor my appointment time ( which in my case it was putting me in front of a dozen other people who were there before me as a walk-in), the whole experience from start to finish was extremely fast, easy, and took all of that dreaded hectic chaos and out of the equation that would‚Äôve been a nightmare no doubt otherwise. And it left a big chunk of my day to me instead of waiting in a clinic for hours trying to please a unhappy toddler. more Hi there, and thank you for taking the time to leave a thoughtful, and thorough review. We appreciate you sharing your experience and we're thrilled that booking ahead helped you and your little one spend less time waiting for the visit! more"
