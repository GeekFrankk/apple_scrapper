      "review": "I have enjoyed using nurse grid for the last 5 years! It has helped me to not miss a shift and make adjustments based on my employers schedule grid. I can just open up the app and adjust easily what is listed online. It also helps me keep track of the shifts I charge, precept, attend education, PTO, time off and of course payday. It‚Äôs a quick reference guide when called to ask if you can work extra! Nurse grid also helps me to know and manage MY work time versus FAMILY time. I love the color options and icons. I even use nurse grid as my Calendar versus my phone or wall calendar! If I could change one thing about nurse grid though it would be the option to be able to see at least two items on the actual day of each month instead of just one or tapping to see if there is any pertinent items scheduled for your shift. For example, if I‚Äôm charging and precepting on the same shift I would like to see ‚ÄúC‚Äù and ‚ÄúP‚Äù on the display calendar instead of clicking each date to view details. Thank you nurse grid! more Hi there! Thanks so much for your review and feedback, we truly appreciate it! We'll pass along your feedback regarding the information displayed on each day in the calendar view to our Product Team.

      "review": "I think this is a good app but is definitely not great. It feels very aged to me. There are apps with more functionality and more features. I think this is used because it‚Äôs just a standard with nurses, everyone just hops in cuz it‚Äôs what‚Äôs popular. Not sure if that‚Äôs why there are few updates and far between. Simple is good which is a great part of this app but there aredefinitely ways that can make it more user friendly and keep up with the times. With this app being out 4 years. I‚Äôm just expecting more. As others have suggested a dark mode would be appreciated as well as the ability to have a widget on your Home Screen for quick and easy viewing. More colors, icons that pertain to other aspects of life. I would also like to maybe have days with multiple events have a split color to see that my day isn‚Äôt just full of one thing without having to click on the dots for everyday I have lots going on. Also, definitely need to be able to compare multiple colleagues. Fortunately for me, I have more than one friend/coworker so it would be great to be able to pair up my schedule with ALL of them . Good app but can be better. Other Apps are too advanced for it to not have these features . Developers-I feel like need to be a little more innovative with ideas and make it a priority to push out not only bug fixes but ALSO new features, maybe a slightly different upgraded interface. more Hi there! Thanks so much for taking the time to write out your thoughts. We truly appreciate your suggestions on how NurseGrid can be better. As you pointed out, many of these suggestions have also been made by other users, and have not gone unnoticed by our Product Team, who are working to implement them. We look forward to sharing our progress and updates with you in the future! more"
