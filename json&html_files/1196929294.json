      "review": "Shoreham Medical is truly exceptional, thanks to the outstanding team of professionals who work there. Every staff member is wonderful, but I‚Äôd like to give special recognition to Jenn, who consistently goes above and beyond. She genuinely cares about her patients, and you can feel her dedication in every interaction. Kim is also fantastic and provides top-notch care. However, I do have one concern: the recent installation of a check-in kiosk. This change feels impersonal and detached, taking away a key part of the experience‚Äîinteracting with the staff members we‚Äôve known and trusted for years. While the staff is no longer allowed to check you in unless there‚Äôs an issue with the kiosk, it feels like a step backward in patient care. I wish I could speak to the person who thought this was a good idea. If this trend continues, I worry that soon we‚Äôll be talking to machines instead of the compassionate professionals who make this practice special. Please don‚Äôt overlook the incredible team here. They are the heart of Shoreham Medical, and their commitment to their patients is something that technology simply can‚Äôt replace. more"

      "review": "My question is how is it possible that I will take my girl to the emergency room on Wednesday the 15th with a fever of 102 and pain in her body? The girl was diagnosed with a urine infection and influenza, they sent me home with antibiotics, but the The girl continued with a fever between 103 ‚Äî-105 on Saturday I returned her to the emergency room with a high fever and a swollen side of the face, I explained to the doctor that I felt that something was wrong with the girl's body, especially in her mouth, which looked infected They told me that her mouth looked fine and that the infection with the antibiotic would disappear, in the emergency room the girl had a fever of 103.5 and they still sent me home. On Monday I called the emergency because the girl continued with a fever of 105 even taking two antibiotics and they told me that a nurse would call me back and that never happened. On Tuesday morning I brought her to her pediatrician and she drew blood and did the tests which came out abnormal and at night the girl's tooth fell out and she almost choked on it. On Wednesday I brought Amelia to the dentist and they brought me to the emergency room at Bellevue hospital for surgery and here we have 4 days and we don't know when we're going home. This situation could have been avoided and I hope it doesn't happen to another Child. more"

      "review": "For the last two years this app has been used continually by me to coordinate my husbands many many doctors appointments and monitor test results. It‚Äôs super easy learning to use on-the-fly and even allows you to communicate directly with your doctors!!! It also enables connection to other hospitals running on EPIC, (which clearly allows U/X personalization -meaning other hospitals can design their app differently so when you look for information it won‚Äôt be laid out the same) which is great for coordinating care and enabling multiple providers across health systems to share test results, and to read notes from other doctor visits, enabling greater continuity of patient care. Having had my husband in multiple hospitals, over a recent two-year period, can confidently say this is by far the best use of the customization functionality. Well well done and THANK YOU - this app helps me keep my husband alive!! more"
