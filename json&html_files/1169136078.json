      "review": "This app has helped my husband and I so much. Our first baby was a dream sleeper from the start. She ate and slept on a very regular schedule and automatically adjusted as she went and around daycare. She definitely ruined us for our second. Our second baby has thrown us for a loop. She didnâ€™t eat regularly and ended up having a milk protein allergy. She canâ€™t have casein or whey. Luckily she doesnâ€™t have a soy allergy and we switched to that. The app helped us track her feedings so we knew how much she was taking in and how frequently and what her stools were like and her symptoms. It also helped us narrow in her sleep issues and figure out when she needed a nap as she didnâ€™t give off all the regular cues and constantly fought sleep. At 4 months we started sleep training and the app has been immensely helpful in getting her on a schedule. There are only two things I wish were improved. I wish the live tracking had bottle feeding and not just nursing as an option. Second, I wish the activity had a custom option so I could add a button for track cranial band time. Our baby has Torticoils and is in PT but also needs a cranial band and we need to track wearing time u til we get up to 23 hours. As my husband and I rotate time while we work from home we need to be able to communicate without actually talking as we sometimes switch during meetings or nap time. more"

      "review": "This app was recommended to me as a first time Mom with a cryptic pregnancy since I had no time to prepare for my baby, and it is incredibly useful to feel like I donâ€™t have to remember everything when it comes to when I last changed his diaper or fed him, but I will say the one downside to this app, to no fault of its own, is that as a Mom whole is already struggling to balance so many things at once, Iâ€™ve found myself obsessing over when I forget to log something immediately or if the app doesnâ€™t layout schedules properly. For an example, it will tell me in one tab how many feedings there have been for the day. In another where I can view the week schedule, itâ€™ll break down my entries and for some reason it has separated one feeding session into two depending on how long our session was, making me think that from the other tab I have fed him more times that I actually have. Itâ€™s a bit confusing and I found myself trying to figure out why it has these weird quirks to the point that I looked down at my baby and took a big breath, realizing that it was really not the priority ðŸ˜† Once again, an excellent app when it comes to struggling to keep track of so much, but if you find yourself being prone to over stressing about everything, it would give you some peace of mind to try it but also see how you do without it. Iâ€™ve enjoyed more just listening to and learning from my baby and his habits naturally and creating my own habits off of his! more Hi there, Thank you for your positive review! We are so glad you are experiencing the magic of Huckleberry! We'd love to understand how we can improve and earn a better rating! Let us know at support@huckleberry-labs.com. We will look forward to hearing from you! more"

      "review": "I started using Huckleberry when my son was about 6 weeks old. Itâ€™s the best one I found for tracking things like food, diapers, sleep, etc., and I tried basically all of the free apps. But then when he hit 2 months and the app started giving me the suggestions for his wake and sleep windows...good god...our lives did a 180 in the best possible way. Iâ€™ve never utilized the premium features, only the free app. Within about two weeks of using it after her hit the age where it would make sleep time predictions (2 months), and sticking to the recommended wake windows, my son was sleeping through the night at about 9 or 10 weeks old, and since then heâ€™s had two nights with one wakeup (heâ€™s now 6.5 months). Was it the app? I think so. It seems to work like magic. Iâ€™m part of a mom group, and we all started using it. Every single person has had the same magical results. Give it about a week of logging everything and really stick to the suggestions and youâ€™ll be amazed. Baby doesnâ€™t seem tired but app says itâ€™s nap time? Try taking baby to their sleep space and marvel at how they will fall asleep. It can read your babyâ€™s mind and you wonâ€™t even care that it feels a little creepy and on-the-nose because your child will sleep. I love this app so much that Iâ€™ve put off writing my review because I wanted to make sure I conveyed how wonderful it is. I hope I have! more"
