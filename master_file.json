        "review": "As another patient said before this USED to be a great app. My husband and mother could go on and look at labs, visit notes, etc. it’s ridiculous. I have been diagnosed in October of 2017 with a new illness. I’m seeing multiple providers for this issue. I required about 10-12 vials of blood to be drawn. I have a port because my veins are useless. So 2 of my other specialists sent lab requests over to Texas Oncology because they drew from my port. These were extremely important tests. It’s been over a month and not only have the labs not posted but there was no mention of my low iron that I have treatments for. In addition my physician got a little agitated saying that having all those tests run there was not going to work. He said he doesn’t read those labs and since it’s under his name he could be liable. Well, ok they are the ones who suggested this because it’s nearly impossible to draw from my veins. So I’m kinda stuck. I’ve sent messages thru this ridiculous “portal” which was the one thing baylor had going for it and now it’s useless too. Lastly I have a patient portal thru Texas Oncology and it’s no better. I don’t know what happened but it’s a real shame and disappointment because you can never get info by calling dr or nurse. Standard is “ let me pull that up and I’ll call you back or I’ll send results to your email. You are forgotten before the phone hangs up! more We would like to learn more about this experience and put you in touch with a representative in our patient relations department to assist.

I have been coming here for two decades. Here I’ve been guided in best practices for managing my type 2 diabetes—from nutrition to a progression of medication that helped me manage my diabetes and maintain blood sugar control. As new medicines have become available on the market, these informed doctors converse with me about them and possible logical next steps, such as the Ozempic semiglutide I began in June of 2022, and I’m now taking with great results. I’ve seen success personally in maintaining my overall health and well being after having diabetes for 27 years.

        "review": "I access this app to view documents, appointments, test results and communicate with drs offices for my 77yo father. I’m able to navigate things myself but it’s not very user friendly for older patients. This should be streamlined in a way that makes it much easier for older patients to navigate and access their information. For example accessing test results takes extra clicks to links within messages to access when they could be simplified by clicking on “test results” and viewing a list of results by date with a comprehensive naming for the result so that I know what type of test it was before opening them. Instead I have to click “test results” and then click a link in a message to view them not knowing what results I’m viewing until they open. Also, I would suggest adding a feature for archiving messages in bulk or at least having an option to slide left or right to mark messages as “read”. There are multiple other improvements like these that could improve the user experience for this app and more importantly make this easier to navigate for elder patients. Overall I’m able to get the information I need for my dad and give it 4 stars. However, I doubt that the elder community currently utilizes this much due to the difficulty they likely have with navigation and overall user experience. more Hi Robnation101, user experience is very important to us, and we appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback.

This app provides so much information, it truly goes above and beyond!

While the premium version is nice the free version is very insightful and would work well for anyone who wants to know more about what there apple watch is tracking and how that data looks for your health. One of the best parts about this app is that if you do want to upgrade to the premium subscription you can choose which parts you want and only buy those, choose one of the package plans or buy the complete version which is a ONE TIME FEE!!! No monthly subscription!! Not to mention very budget and broke college student friendly as far as price :) It’s also surprisingly motivating when you really look at the details because it tracks your movement and then it tells you how many times you’ve worked out each month.

The retrospective annual graph shows an increased heart rate during the period I slacked off and fortunately, a corresponding decline beginning when I resumed exercising. The feedback has motivated me to keep exercising. That alone is worth the purchase. The developer has an excellent User Interface sense. Want better detail on a part of a graph? Just pinch and zoom and you have it. You might think “Pfff! Pinch and zoom is not new!” You would be right but their are too many apps that don’t implement it when they should. This one does.

A national faculty has compiled a summary of expert knowledge to help diagnose athletic injuries (history, physical examination, and imaging), determine the ability of athletes to play their sport, recommend treatment in the training room and beyond, and estimate return to play time. This information is presented in a highly structured and searchable format that allows quick access to key points to consider when making an informed medical decision. The knowledge in this App is meant to serve as a guideline, especially since this field is still largely an \"ART\": it is more expert opinion than high-level evidence-based studies. As an \"ART\" there are few absolutes, particularly regarding return to play, so one must weigh the risk-benefit for the athlete at a given level of competition with medical providers. This App is meant to serve as a helpful guide and reference to aid the medical provider into an individualized discussion of the risks and benefits of treatment and returning to the field in game time and in the training room. The information in this educational App is provided for general medical education purposes only and is not meant to substitute for the independent medical judgment of a physician relative to the diagnostic and treatment options of a specific patient's medical condition.

I love the app but liked it better when it had more of my data available to me. Hopefully this can be brought back. I already completed a support ticket right when the update came out thinking maybe the data just got moved. I learned then that the data I was looking for was removed not just moved.

        "review": "I used to love flo. I’ve been using the app since my junior year of high school (I’m now a senior in college). I appreciate how I’ve been able to track my period through the years, as it’s been enormously helpful to my overall health, well-being, and awareness of my body. That being said, I have really struggled with the new updates that flo has undergone. Not only has the app become significantly less user-friendly, but the constant push to “go premium” has really negatively impacted my experience. I understand why they have a premium option, and I respect that it is there, but what I don’t respect is how I’m constantly being mislead in order to be trapped into signing up for a premium subscription. I find it really irresponsible that women who don’t want to pay for this app, will be given insights about their menstrual health, only to find out that they can’t have access to the information behave they don’t have an account! I used the chat feature a few times before, and it’ll leave me responding to chats for about 5 minutes, and right before they give me an answer about my health, they say I need to subscribe! It’s honestly cruel that an app meant to help women feel more secure about their health, is constantly misleading them like this, or trying to buy their desire for basic health info! Most of which can be googled, btw. I’ve really loved using flo, but am honestly considering shifting gears if things don’t change soon. more Hi mallalalalalalalalala, Thank you for sharing this. We’re sorry to hear you’re disappointed that we moved some features out of the free plan. Premium subscriptions fund the ongoing development of the app, while keeping the basics free for everyone.

And I really appreciated being able to track my cycle and have insight as to what I was going through, all the way up to when I got pregnant early last year with my daughter. & then the app didn’t really have much to offer compared to other apps as far as tracking my pregnancy. I redownloaded the app once I started having periods again postpartum and every so many minutes within using the app, it prompts me to purchase the full subscription to be able to use even basic features that used to be available to everyone without purchase. In addition, when it prompts you to make a purchase, it literally forces you to agree and continue into the purchase by not allowing an exit button or anything to back out of the ad until you’re having to deny the purchase when it tries to ask for a payment method. It’s ridiculous that they are so money hungry that they now feel the need to try to force you into a purchase. It will also offer insight on your cycle but then pop up with an ad that you need to make a purchase to even see the insight. Other than being able to enter when you have your period and look back on the calendar, it is now a pointless app, I can literally use the calendar on my phone to do the same thing. more Hi there!

        "review": "I really like this app! It helped me track my cycles and ovulation when I was trying to get pregnant, and then was super easy to swap over when I was finally pregnant! And the pregnancy side of things have been so good!!! I love opening it every day to find my new tips and advice for the day. It also helps me track my water, which I love. But, the new updates it has gone through have been sort of weird. It always prompts me to input my weight to track it, but that feature is gone! There is nowhere for me to input my weight anymore. Also, the chat feature is gone! I liked the “chat” at the beginning of every week even though you can only respond with pre written responses, it was very informative and useful. One week of pregnancy was incorrect (said I was week 8 even though I moved on to week 9) and it didn’t work because it knew something was wrong, and now I haven’t seen it since. Lastly, I loved all the of “stories” that it gave me during first trimester. A week to talk about exercise, a week for nutrition, a week for working while pregnant, etc. but as soon as second trimester hit, there’s nothing! I really looked forward to reading it everyday, but now there’s just a lack of information. I begin to wonder what I’m getting by paying “premium” because it sort of stopped all of the major things it was helping me with. But I loved it, so I’m mostly writing this review to let the creators know what they need to fix and bring back!! more Hi Jess brownie! We’re very sorry to hear that! We really want to help you, but we need to know your identifier in the app to find the reason for the issue and provide a solution. Please contact us from the app (Menu - Help - Contact us), and we’ll get back to you with more details on your request. Kind regards, Flo Team more"

        "review": "When I first tried this product I thought that the cooling moisturizer was a good topper for skincare. Although my acne did reduce, I think I’d prefer products I can use on the daily, your $9 trial is a really good way for people to test your products and see if they’d want to continue using it on the long-term. Needless to say, the acne treatment cream is great and is good for me to use. Sometimes the products are a little tingly though which is fine, however I am on a time cramp in the morning and I like using daily products for sensitive skin, I have products that are not done yet so I will have to use those before trying more MDacne products. You are a great brand with good researchers. It is a little pricy for me to pay the $24 a month thing, but if you’re an adult working and have acne products I think it’s safe to try MDacne continuously and reduce products from different brands as to lower your sensitivity, they say continuity is key and that’s true for skincare, since this brand focuses on acne I hope more people become more confident with your products(acne can make people lose esteem but it’s okay, acne is natural and there’s always a remedy, don’t feel like hope is lost I just know that if your face isn’t super sensitive to customized skincare than that means you can overcome acne within a month to one year) more"

I messaged Dr. Harth about my concerns in hopes he could help me with it. He responded quickly and gave me some advice and a night cream to use every other night aside from my daily routine. If I’m being honest, I stopped using my day cream. I use my day/night wash and my night cream (before bed). I wake up, wash my face with cool water and use a moisturizer by neutrogena (clear face SPF30) break-out free liquid lotion sunscreen through out the day. Also great before foundation (if ever you decide to wear makeup). I’m not saying to stop using your day cream. Everyone’s skin is not the same, just like their skin care products. Whatever works for you, great! Don’t hesitate to message the Doctors if you can’t seem to find the right routine for you! Thank you McAcne! I’ve never felt so confident about my facial skin since middle school! I appreciate all the help I’ve received and I’m definitely gonna continue using your products! THANK YOU! 😁✊🏼 more This is music to our ears! Great suggestion to other folks to use the dermatologist chat support during treatment!

Right in the beginning of using their products my skin started to get dry and worse but as time went on there has been a lot of improvement. Throughout 7 months I’ve been using it I’ve had times when my skin was at its best but then right after I thought everything was getting better. I got more and more breakouts. I’ve seen a big improvement in my skin from when I first started. Everyone’s skin is different but the process takes time and it’s definitely worth it. I still do have acne now and acne scars but it’s way better than before. The staff are great and help me with all my questions I have about my skin or about other products on the app. Although I’m still unhappy with how my face looks I still gotta wait until it gets better. The products really do help and work but IT TAKES TIME. So don’t be all mad when your skin doesn’t clear up in the first month because it’s not how it’s works. This product has helped me a lot and can’t wait until my skin is all cleared!! more"

        "review": "I’ve had three prescriptions sent to this pharmacy service. The only one that went through correctly or on time was the first one. I just got off a 30 minute chat with the web support team because my app shows “refill on schedule” for a medication that, according to the chat team, was never being processed by the pharmacy. I never received a notification or call that my medication wasn’t being processed and therefore wasn’t being “refilled on schedule.” Even now I cannot find anything on the website or the app showing that my medication actually isn’t being processed despite being available for refill now. I’m glad I realized it wasn’t being filled before I was completely out of my medication, too bad I only have one day left to find someone else to fill it. I will call my pharmacy tomorrow and get this sorted out, but it’s ridiculous and unsafe that I had to do this much digging to find that my medication wasn’t being filled. What if I was an elderly patient waiting on a more serious medication? They wouldn’t be able to navigate this confusing system to even realize they weren’t getting their medication before it was too late. more Hello, we apologize for the inconvenience that you are experiencing with your prescription order. We understand that this is a very frustrating experience. If you are still unable to resolve it with your pharmacy, please reach out to support@nimblerx.com again and we will help resolve your issue! more"

Klara expedites the communication process in an extremely efficient manner that my patients really appreciate. We are able to communicate with our patients in an efficient user friendly manner that reduces or eliminates phone call waiting time and expedites the process for everyone involved. Our staff send patients their referral information via Klara, communicate about missed appointments through Klara, and send patients treatment plans, lab work data and other test results via Klara to name just a few of the benefits. Voice phone call messages are transcribed into Klara text messages which our staff can more efficiently respond to. We found that our electronic health record patient portal system was too cumbersome to use. Less than 10% of our patients got enrolled and utilized the system. When we switched to Klara, we achieved greater than an 80% utilization rate by our patients. Regardless of the patient’s computer skills and educational background, we were able to enroll them in less than 30 seconds compared to over five minutes with the patient portal. In summary, Klara has been a great asset to our medical practice and has become our go to #1 patient communication/engagement software tool. If you’re looking for a more efficient tool to communicate with your patients, I would highly recommend looking at Klara. more"

I called Friday with a problem about my pain medicines that needed a refill for the next month. For some unknown reason, my refills had been sent to a new and unknown pharmacy, even though my medical file listed my pharmacy as Walgreens in Collinsville. The new pharmacy was a small one, and didn’t have one of my medicines. They knew they could order the medicine, but there was a minimum order to deal with. Pharmacies must dispose of expired medicines, and loose money if this happens often. The owner of the pharmacy requested that I get my prescriptions at my regular pharmacy. Fine by me, since they were also more expensive. This problem happened again this month! I have been trying to get them to move my scripts using Klara, but I have been ignored since Friday. Hey! These are medicines I need to control my pain! This is not making me very happy! more"

I was 100% confident in his care. I am still healing, however, I saw the results immediately and each day going forward, I see the results and they are fabulous.

Human Factors methodology was leveraged to guide interfaces that provide rapid access to information and assessment tools, which facilitate an efficient aid for care management while decreasing cognitive load for the user. Additionally, for users who seek care for patients at The Children’s Mercy Hospital, PedsGuide features a quick-call feature to contact the Children’s Mercy Contact Center and Critical Care Transport Team in our service area. *While PedsGuide is a helpful tool, it is not intended to replace the independent judgment and evaluation of health care providers and emergency personnel.

I submitted some pictures of my bills and within a few days they had accessed my claims, gotten in touch with the office billing department for me, and have notified me of the errors made. They got me a refund for everything I was overcharged for and it took me no longer than 5 minutes to provide the info they needed without making any calls in the process. They have been efficient in helping me find providers in my network and answering any and all questions I’ve had.

I am not normally one to review since I’m pretty patient and understand things happen but wow this has been an awful experience! There’s been so much run around. There’s no quick explanation I can give, so here’s the full story: When they first called, I couldn’t hear anything on the other line. No big deal, I get that glitches happen. But when I got a call saying they’d tried calling back and I wasn’t answering when the doctor called, I started to get a little irritated. I wasn’t getting any calls. They called later to give me the same speech. I was like please just connect me since obviously they’re not getting through. When I was connected I could barely hear the doctor, so I wasn’t even sure who I was talking to. He seemed to get irritated with me, and then just prescribed me something, I’m not sure what, and hung up. Mind you, I’m at work while this is all going down. I have to keep getting up from my desk on a very busy day to take care of this. Then, my phone starts absolutely blowing up. Call after call. I reject them because I’m very busy and tired of the back and forth, but they keep calling. After about 8 rejected calls I answer. And of course, there’s nobody on the line. Never never using this app again. Horrible experience. more"

Now, HealthJoy does this all for me by not only looking at providers’ reviews but their proximity to where I live, hospital affiliation, and checking to see if they are in-network as well and even offers to make appointments for me!

I have been using my ResMed CPAP for over 3 years now and I do not understand all of the negative reviews for this app. I read several and have been sitting here shaking my head. People complaining about how their machine operates and whatnot. I have several bones to pick with my machine, which maybe 2 or 3 days a week decides it wants to perform like a jet engine on take off. But this review is for the app, which does exactly what it is meant to do - syncs with your ResMed and shows you the sleep data, which takes some time to sync from the previous sleep cycle (about 10 minutes? I’m not sure since I don’t sync it immediately after waking up). I use the app while on WiFi, with a VPN, and have no issues connecting to my machine. I’ve used the app while on crappy hotel WiFi as well with no problems. This app shows the bare basics so if you want a more accurate account of how you are sleeping, take the memory card to your doctor and they can look at the data more thoroughly. Or buy a Fitbit, even the basic ones will show you your sleep cycle with REM data. This app gives you a very basic account of how you slept the previous night so it performs as advertised. more"

Because of my job I don’t get to bed until after midnight. So as an example: I go to bed after 3 am Friday and wake up generally around 10:30 or 11:00 am on Friday. Yet my data when it finally comes through shows up as Thursday? I kept track of the time on CPAP therapy whenever I wake up. And that’s the time it shows up as the previous day’s data. Why? Also, is there any way to get much more in-depth information like what the Doctor would see from machine data? I think that would be awesome to see that. Note: Just received a response yesterday after I wrote the above review. It was a really good explanation about the time running noon to noon of the following day. Now I understand. Looking at the app information further, it does seem to give you the information in regards to Compliance Issues that are required for say DOT in the case of Commercial Truck Drivers. Again you’ll still need a detailed report from your Doctor for the required physical. I changed my rating to 5 instead of the original 4 stars. more The device records data from a period of 12 PM (noon) to 12 PM (noon) of the following day, in order to consecutively capture the most common sleeping patterns within one “night” of therapy use. If you tend to consistently sleep with the same time period each day, there should be no compliance issues when it provides data reports but if you do still have concerns, you can speak with your doctor or DME provider and they can provide further information on this and help determine whether more detailed reports that break the data out by session might provide better guidance. They can also provide you with a printout of your full report by request, for clinical or compliance purposes as needed. more"

I went through the walk through of the machine with the Resmed representative and started using it that same evening. I needed to get 4 hrs a night and I had to work at it. The comfort of the mask is paramount to having a successful experience with the machine. I was able get my 4 hrs but I really had to work at it. I did notice almost immediately my neuropathy went away and that was a blessing in itself. But I wasn’t sleeping with the mask on, I was just making sure I got my 4 hrs. Sometimes I would wear it for an hour and off for two and then on for an hour, sleep for 2 and then back on for an hour or as long as I could handle it. I finally remembered that I was sent a different mask and Of course my wife knew exactly where it was. The mask was a little different and it only had one headband and it was a nose mask. It was so much lighter, the first night I used it I slept 9 hours. I’ve since been getting my 7 hrs of sleep almost every night. Don’t settle for being uncomfortable with your mask, find the right one for you. It’s the difference of making it work for you or not. more"

This is for YOU! Hear My Baby is the leading app since 2018, allows you to use just your iPhone microphone to record and share your baby’s beat sounds. It is the best-in-class, has over 5000 5* ratings, is super simple and safe to use. Supports Apple Airpods and Bluetooth Headphones. \"It took some time and patience... thank you for creating this cheap, awesome technology to use at home.\" - Niki Category #1 in the USA and 102 other countries. Here's why... Developed by parents like you (with expertise in sound engineering and apps) who wanted a trustworthy way to record our baby's fetal sounds (kicks, heart beat etc.) - and keep a record of a quality that we hadn't been able to find before in other apps. Extensively tested on expectant mothers with over 450,000 downloads since launch! \"I was skeptical at first. Great app! Worth it.\" - Legretta **** But honestly, does it actually work?? **** Yes. We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the baby's heart beat, sounds (kicks, heartbeat and more) and using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear. NOTE: It takes time, technique and patience and depends on the position and number of weeks of your baby so you'll need to stick with it. When you do, our results are excellent. Results are best between 27-40 weeks as your baby is bigger and stronger. We constantly improve our extensive tutorial and techniques to handhold you through - we even have a support group on Facebook to help. We want you to be happy with Hear My Baby heartbeat and to monitor results can sometimes be difficult. If you are struggling (can't find your own heartbeat etc.) DO contact us via support. We want to help you! GIFT THIS APP: Click the “Buy App” arrow on the iTunes® App Store FAQs **** No Accessories Required **** We use the internal microphone from your phone to attempt to listen and record your fetal sound. We recommend Bluetooth Headphones for best results. **** How It Works **** 1. Hear My Baby, has been precisely engineered to listen to abdominal sounds, then record and amplify them. Listen to your own heartbeat first to confirm the app is set up correctly. 2. It works best when baby is head down and their back is facing forwards. 3. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room and focus on your lower abdomen. Listen then Tap record. 4. Our simple recording management helps you to keep a record of your special moment 5. Take a selfie if you wish and share 6. We'll walk you through exactly how to get the best baby heartbeat results. **** Easy Share Feature **** Sharing is awesome you can opt to share via Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram or email. **** We Care About Your Privacy **** We take your privacy and special moment seriously. You decide who sees or hears it and can delete it at any time. **** Before you start... **** You DO need to carefully follow the instructions for Hear My Baby to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super sensitive. HMB doesn't fake the baby heartbeat or other fetal sounds :) Please Note: results are normally superb, however the recording may not work if your placenta is at the front of the tummy or the baby is in the wrong position. **** Supported Phones **** 15, 14, 13,12, X, Xs, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6. We don't support iPad. **** Worried about safety? We are too! *** HMB is safe but to be extra sure DO switch your iPhone to airplane mode. This is a precaution and automatically stops all cellular transmissions. **** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? **** No - under no circumstances is HMB a substitute for medical support - if you don't get a result it doesn't mean anything is wrong :) Consult your doctor for any advice. We are NOT approved by the FDA. This is not a medical device and is not a medical baby heartbeat monitor. It is for FUN. Please do check our T&Cs before downloading.

Despite my reservations I downloaded it anyway and was disappointed I couldn’t find her to save my life. I was about 22 weeks at the time so I figured I’d surely be able to find her heartbeat being halfway through my pregnancy. I almost undownloaded the app and asked for a refund but something told me to just wait and I’m glad I did. I’m 25 weeks now & was able to find her heartbeat almost immediately after hitting the listen button. I maybe could’ve found her earlier but I waited a little longer just to make sure her heartbeat was strong enough to really be picked up by the app versus at the drs office. I’m glad I kept the app and would highly recommend it to future moms. I’d just tell them to give yourself some time if you don’t hear the baby at first and not to get discouraged. more"

Sounds just like a babys heartbeat except there’s absolutely no baby, another mom used it when she wasn't even pregnant and she found a babys heartbeat another mom as taken tests, all are negative results but she also has found a babys heartbeat, its sad how we moms are getting false a manipulating sounds !!!Please MOMS do not use this app for peace of mind or for reassurance! If you are having an issue don’t hesitate for one second to see your provider or the nearest ER! DO NOT TRUST THIS APP OR ANY APP when it comes to your pregnancy or your health! Trust medical testing, see your provider! Be excited for your pregnancy and excited about your visits to see your baby on ultrasound and a medical doppler! Best of luck to all you mommys and your sweet babies!!! more Hello SOFCC, thank you for your comment, and in the strongest possible terms we do not recommend downloading HMB for reassurance, and we make that clear in all our information, it is NOT a medical device. We also recommend trying the app only after 16 weeks and not before and best results around 27-30 weeks. To address the issue you raise - the recording you posted, which we've listened to, sounds like it is caused by the volume being too high and is a sound feedback loop (often appearing to have a high BPM - but we don't include a feature to measure this within the app). We recommend that the volume is placed at 20-30%. This is a common issue and may have been the cause of the other case you mention. We do provide advice on this in the instructions and in the FAQ (there is a section on 'MY SOFA HAS A HEARTBEAT!') which discusses this. To be clear, we do not manipulate anything within the app, if we did everyone would give us a 5* rating and perfect results, and that isn't the case and is why our rating is only 4/5. We do offer support to all our customers through the GET SUPPORT button and we're always happy to help and discuss any issues and help where we can. We're very sorry you've had a bad experience with the app, with best wishes, The HMB Team. more"

        "review": "I’m 12 wks pregnant, & I was skeptical when I downloaded this app because I had been unsuccessful with finding my baby’s heartbeat using other free apps. I tried for about an hour at first, but couldn’t find baby at all. I didn’t get discouraged bc I knew baby was doing fine. I decided to take a break & try once more before bed. I found the heartbeat within 10 minutes on the second try! I can’t explain it, but I knew what it was instantly after hearing. I will say that one sign of successfully locating the heartbeat was seeing the steady rhythm being shown on the screen. If you don’t know what to listen for, look for that first and the sound will match! I also had a full bladder when I checked the second time so I think that helped. Don’t trust the free apps because I kept my phone on baby’s location and could not hear anything through them. This is the first time I’ve listened to a Facebook ad and paid for an app... ever lol. Also my first app review so it’s definitely worth it! more"

I don’t think it’s worth the money. I did the yearly subscription which showed that I could pay 8 dollars per month which would total yo about 100 dollars a year. I was just charged 100 dollars outright instead of 8 dollars a month. This is really upsetting because I feel as tho I have been misinformed with my subscription and I am a college student who does not have to finances to pay that outright. There are other apps that will be more worth your time that are free. more Thank you for sharing your feedback with us. We’re sorry to hear that your experience hasn’t fully met your expectations, and we’d like to address your concerns. First, regarding the 3D models, we take great pride in offering one of the most detailed and anatomically accurate models available, especially when compared to free alternatives. Our team of experts works hard to ensure that the models are comprehensive and precise, but we understand that there may be certain terms or landmarks that differ from what you're used to. If you could provide specific examples, we’d be happy to address this and improve your learning experience further. Regarding the subscription charge, we understand how frustrating this can be. Our yearly subscription is set up to offer a discounted rate for the full year, which is why it’s billed upfront at $100 rather than in monthly installments. We apologize if this wasn’t clear during the purchase process. As a college student, we want to ensure that Easy Anatomy remains accessible to you, and we'd be happy to look into possible solutions, such as adjusting your plan or issuing a partial refund. Please don’t hesitate to reach out so we can resolve this issue and ensure Easy Anatomy continues to support your studies effectively. We truly value your business and your feedback.

The Only change I would suggest is the graphing of the data should be displayed horizontally not gust vertically because it compresses the data to much over time and hard to read. I check my A1c 4 Times a day; X 30 days =120 data points. Vertical room on my screen is about 2.5 inches , horizontally it’s about 8.5 inches . Thanks !

For the most part it works fine but a few minor but deal killers for me.. First is the blood sugar is REQUIRED for an entry, sometimes a BG is not necessary if you are bolusing after a check/bolus/correction. I end up using the previous blood sugar and it messes with the averages displayed on the home screen. Second is the graph, when selecting a blood sugar it only displays the number and date, the time is not included which makes it difficult to target the exact time frame of a high/low trend. Third the contact information doesn’t work, it always displays “Cannot connect to server” at the top every time. There is also no feature for diet other than a notes section on each entry. Perhaps once the bug with the contact method is fixed and I can get in touch I will change my review. This app has great potential but for me it’s not quite there yet. more Hi there, Thank you for your feedback and review. We have fixed the bug with the in-app support.

        "review": "This app has helped my husband and I so much. Our first baby was a dream sleeper from the start. She ate and slept on a very regular schedule and automatically adjusted as she went and around daycare. She definitely ruined us for our second. Our second baby has thrown us for a loop. She didn’t eat regularly and ended up having a milk protein allergy. She can’t have casein or whey. Luckily she doesn’t have a soy allergy and we switched to that. The app helped us track her feedings so we knew how much she was taking in and how frequently and what her stools were like and her symptoms. It also helped us narrow in her sleep issues and figure out when she needed a nap as she didn’t give off all the regular cues and constantly fought sleep. At 4 months we started sleep training and the app has been immensely helpful in getting her on a schedule. There are only two things I wish were improved. I wish the live tracking had bottle feeding and not just nursing as an option. Second, I wish the activity had a custom option so I could add a button for track cranial band time. Our baby has Torticoils and is in PT but also needs a cranial band and we need to track wearing time u til we get up to 23 hours. As my husband and I rotate time while we work from home we need to be able to communicate without actually talking as we sometimes switch during meetings or nap time. more"

        "review": "This app was recommended to me as a first time Mom with a cryptic pregnancy since I had no time to prepare for my baby, and it is incredibly useful to feel like I don’t have to remember everything when it comes to when I last changed his diaper or fed him, but I will say the one downside to this app, to no fault of its own, is that as a Mom whole is already struggling to balance so many things at once, I’ve found myself obsessing over when I forget to log something immediately or if the app doesn’t layout schedules properly. For an example, it will tell me in one tab how many feedings there have been for the day. In another where I can view the week schedule, it’ll break down my entries and for some reason it has separated one feeding session into two depending on how long our session was, making me think that from the other tab I have fed him more times that I actually have. It’s a bit confusing and I found myself trying to figure out why it has these weird quirks to the point that I looked down at my baby and took a big breath, realizing that it was really not the priority 😆 Once again, an excellent app when it comes to struggling to keep track of so much, but if you find yourself being prone to over stressing about everything, it would give you some peace of mind to try it but also see how you do without it. I’ve enjoyed more just listening to and learning from my baby and his habits naturally and creating my own habits off of his! more Hi there, Thank you for your positive review! We are so glad you are experiencing the magic of Huckleberry! We'd love to understand how we can improve and earn a better rating! Let us know at support@huckleberry-labs.com.

        "review": "I started using Huckleberry when my son was about 6 weeks old. It’s the best one I found for tracking things like food, diapers, sleep, etc., and I tried basically all of the free apps. But then when he hit 2 months and the app started giving me the suggestions for his wake and sleep windows...good god...our lives did a 180 in the best possible way. I’ve never utilized the premium features, only the free app. Within about two weeks of using it after her hit the age where it would make sleep time predictions (2 months), and sticking to the recommended wake windows, my son was sleeping through the night at about 9 or 10 weeks old, and since then he’s had two nights with one wakeup (he’s now 6.5 months). Was it the app? I think so. It seems to work like magic. I’m part of a mom group, and we all started using it. Every single person has had the same magical results. Give it about a week of logging everything and really stick to the suggestions and you’ll be amazed. Baby doesn’t seem tired but app says it’s nap time? Try taking baby to their sleep space and marvel at how they will fall asleep. It can read your baby’s mind and you won’t even care that it feels a little creepy and on-the-nose because your child will sleep. I love this app so much that I’ve put off writing my review because I wanted to make sure I conveyed how wonderful it is. I hope I have! more"

Even the care tips were able to provide relevant information. When we had questions not already answered by the care tips or their records, the chat with a vet feature was a quick way to find an answer. That worked out way better than I anticipated.

        "review": "I suffered from depression for many years in my life, in 2018 I discovered this app to help cope with it. Daylio at first was simplistic for me. I would choose a happy face or sad face depending on my mood and leave a short blurb of the day sometimes. It was easy enough for me to do and didn’t require that much effort so building the habit of early journaling was easy. little by little I added activities so I didn’t necessarily even have to type anything but could just choose an activity I did, it helped me begin to be able to track what was making me happy and what was making me sad and spotting the consistency of these activities correlating with my moods. Almost 6 years later, my journal entries have become very detailed. If I’m trying to recall what I did days, weeks, or even months ago, I have the resource to find it. Daylio is become the single most important app on my phone because it’s help me establish a record of my life. The continued updates have made it worth buying the premium version. You don’t require subscription to use it as so many other apps and services nowadays have become obsessed with bleeding consumers dry. I recommend this app to anybody who feels like they’re in a rut, to anyone who needs an eye-opening self reflection tool. Do you want to get a better understanding of your habits and who you are as a person? This app can be your greatest resource to do so. more"

        "review": "I was looking for a mood tracking app where I could have multiple entries throughout the day, not just one at the end. I use this app to help track my anxiety and how I feel leading up to an anxious period as well as other moods. I love that I can go back and add entries even days later if I forgot. I also love that it’s completely customizable and I can have tons of options. I did end up upgrading to premium to unlock unlimited moods and activities because I find it really beneficial and absolutely worth the around $20 a year. I have an activities folder with ranges for my heart rate so so can track that during an anxiety attack, I have one with different physical symptoms like sweaty, dizzy, etc., and even a folder for methods and techniques I’ve already tried to calm down. I hate having to type out every little thing so being able to just go through and simply pick what applies at the moment is great. The small comment section is great as well if I want to add a small note about something that might be important but not frequent enough for its own button. This app is really fantastic for helping track moods and keeping a record of how I am feeling and when in an easy to use format that’s customizable to every person, even down to the color scheme. I started off simply looking for an app where I could have more than one daily entry but this app goes above and beyond. more"

        "review": "I have always loved to journal and document both important and mundane days in my life. It’s easy to do with this app, even if you only have a few minutes to check in with yourself to see how you are feeling. All you do is click a few buttons to record what you’ve been doing and how you feel, the app records the time stamp and you’re done! Or if you have more time you can add text too - a little or a lot - I’ve written paragraphs at times. As someone diagnosed bipolar over 20 years ago, using this app is a great way to track moods (I too am in to the popular “mindfulness” trend, even before it became popular): it allows me to pause throughout the day, take a few minutes to sit quietly, notice how my body feels, see what kind of feelings my thoughts bring up in me, and then record that snapshot. Then, at any time I can look at the app’s simple reports that show a variety of trends in you activities and mood over a given period of time. I may think, “wow, I’ve been down and frustrated a lot lately” and then look over the report for the month and see that I actually had a lot of really positive times too. It helps me focus on the positive and work on training my brain not to go automatically to the negative. With practice, our brains CAN be rewired that way! I’ve done it successfully with a couple different things I wanted to change. Anyway, try the app. It’s great! more"

Every staff member is wonderful, but I’d like to give special recognition to Jenn, who consistently goes above and beyond. She genuinely cares about her patients, and you can feel her dedication in every interaction. Kim is also fantastic and provides top-notch care. However, I do have one concern: the recent installation of a check-in kiosk. This change feels impersonal and detached, taking away a key part of the experience—interacting with the staff members we’ve known and trusted for years. While the staff is no longer allowed to check you in unless there’s an issue with the kiosk, it feels like a step backward in patient care. I wish I could speak to the person who thought this was a good idea. If this trend continues, I worry that soon we’ll be talking to machines instead of the compassionate professionals who make this practice special. Please don’t overlook the incredible team here. They are the heart of Shoreham Medical, and their commitment to their patients is something that technology simply can’t replace. more"

On Monday I called the emergency because the girl continued with a fever of 105 even taking two antibiotics and they told me that a nurse would call me back and that never happened.

It’s super easy learning to use on-the-fly and even allows you to communicate directly with your doctors!!! It also enables connection to other hospitals running on EPIC, (which clearly allows U/X personalization -meaning other hospitals can design their app differently so when you look for information it won’t be laid out the same) which is great for coordinating care and enabling multiple providers across health systems to share test results, and to read notes from other doctor visits, enabling greater continuity of patient care. Having had my husband in multiple hospitals, over a recent two-year period, can confidently say this is by far the best use of the customization functionality. Well well done and THANK YOU - this app helps me keep my husband alive!! more"

        "review": "I’m obsessed with learning anything and everything I can about medicine. I would love to work in the medical field and this is helping to show me how the actual dream job really is, what standards they have, and gives me the biggest dopamine rush when I get at least 80%. I never went to even high school, so it rocks that I’m so great with medicine. I mean, 80 %, I’m 28, kept locked in in school suspension my entire childhood and just sometimes really think it’s awesome I can jump into these things and pick them up so easy. My fiancé had Fourniers Gangrene and when they went to show me how I would be packing her wounds, I blew their socks right off. First try. I hope using this app it could prepare me for some job that feeds my passion. 80% Doesn’t seem much but Considering I’ve never even been past grade 9… gives me hope. more"

        "review": "Have gone through about 12 cases so far. I was expecting all of them to be “worst case scenario” situations but was surprised at how varied the cases are. From a ER nurses point of view it’s a fresh way to flex your knowledge and think beyond your scope. You have to assess the patient, consider appropriate lab work, imaging, and choose the right interventions, and of course reassess. A diagnosis must be made for every patient with a decision to admit to the appropriate floor or discharge with or without outpatient follow-up. Vital signs are real-time, and you have to really think on your feet for the critical scenarios to get the patient stabilized. Every case has a full discussion at the end which details exactly what should have been done. All-in-all I think it is a valuable tool, and rather enjoyable! more"

        "review": "This sim is a fantastic tool for current providers, providers in training, and even people interested in medicine. My only suggestion would be adding an ambulance setting for prehospital cases. It would be very beneficial to current EMTs and paramedics - as well as those in class - being able to use it on shift or at home to keep up with their knowledge in a setting familiar to them. This is the first time I’ve ever suggested something on the App Store, so I want to back this up by saying that I know implementing a feature like this can be expensive in time, skill, and money. But I could see a good chance that you will get back whatever you put into it. more"

Find a dermatologist licensed in your state and start a consultation. Get a treatment plan and prescription, if appropriate, within two business days. * PHOTOS AND TELEHEALTH with anyone you like. Ask your doctor and healthcare provider about your usage of the app and if they can receive photos for telehealth consultations or triage. Always follow your doctor’s instructions. * CLOSE-UP PHOTOGRAPHY used for tracking changes in single moles and other local areas on the skin. Miiskin has carefully calibrated the camera for the best possible close-up photography. Log the location on a body chart / map. * IN-APP COMPARISON allows you to get a SIDE-BY-SIDE VIEW of your photos so you can more easily compare them for changes over time. * AUTOMATIC SKIN IMAGING using computer vision and augmented reality technology makes the app capable of taking FULL-BODY IMAGES of you. All you need to do is to place the phone upright on a table with the camera facing the room and it does the rest. Currently available for iPhone XR, XS, 11, 11Pro and SE 2020. * MOLE SIZING helps you measure your moles and lesions over time. Simply add a coin into your close-up photos. * FACE TRACKING lets you take selfies from multiple-angles in seconds to track e.g. acne or skincare results * WEB COMPARE allows you to access your Miiskin App photos in the browser on any tablet or computer with a SIDE-BY-SIDE VIEW. Very useful for you to compare your full-body images for any changes on a larger screen. * SECURITY AND PRIVACY is a big priority for us. Miiskin separates your photos from your normal camera roll and encrypts them so no other apps can access them. You can protect them even more with a PIN-code or your Face/Touch ID and BLUR OUT areas of your full-body photos that you wish to stay private even if you share your photos. MIISKIN DOES NOT PROVIDE A DIAGNOSIS The app does not diagnose your moles or evaluate the risk of melanoma, skin cancer or any other conditions. The app assists you with tracking skin and moles over time with a photo diary. We do not think that with today’s technology, and the present quality of smartphone images, that it is possible to provide AI diagnoses of melanoma or skin cancer risk. If you find a mole or mark that looks concerning you should always consult a certified doctor. THE VISION OF MIISKIN Miiskin’s vision is to help you keep track of skin changes and increase access to dermatology care in the most user-friendly way possible.

    "appDescription": "Buku Medicine was created initially as Buku Haematology, written by a haematology registrar and consultant as an easy and quick reference for the initial investigation and management of common haematology problems. 'Buku' is the Chichewa word for book or reference. Chichewa is spoken in Malawi where our pathology project MPathE is running. We made it to answer the commonest questions that haematologists are asked, and through that, improve patient care, educate our users and hopefully remove some of the fear usually associated with haematology. It is for all grades of generalist and specialist doctors, specialist nurses, physician assistants and has links to key references and guidelines. Data collected from users shows that it can prevent a call to haematology completely for 21% of clinical queries, and start further investigations to expedite care for up to 60% more. This reduces the on-call burden on haematologists and improves patient care by improving clinician efficiency. See our website for testimonials of how it has helped users. This model has been really well received and continues to grow (over 22,000 active users, installed on clinician devices in two NHS trusts and ORCHA approved). We have now started to apply this model to other specialties and have added Renal, Endocrinology, Hepatology and Rheumatology content to the App. We will continue to expand this to other specialties over the coming months. The information included is concise to make it easy to use, and further reading should be undertaken to gain a full understanding of the topics covered. Common causes are listed by frequency from general medical literature and our clinical experience.

Some exercises are just made for people who are fit, young or both. At the beginning the exercises are modified to a beginner, but then they get more challenging. The problem is that after months of exercising when you’re overweight and older, your knees start feeling the pain, so I do recommend they stay on a modified exercise when it comes to putting all the weight on your knees or giving you the option within the app. Also, it’s important to provide two feel good options because it helps you achieve that goal for that day, and also you have an option for those days when your life was crazy busy, active, and full of chaos. Lastly, I have had many problems of it crashing down in the middle of my workout many, many times! This also discourages all the effort we put into a healthier lifestyle. I have even tried it several times, but it constantly crashes down. Also, I can’t even delete and reinstall the app because it might delete all my data. No easy fix for this until now. more Hello!

        "review": "With gyms closed, I decided to look for alternate at home exercises. I am in my late 20s and looking to keep an active and healthy lifestyle. This app has great options. I subscribed and I really enjoy the daily 'do your exercises' that fit directly in what I am looking for. I also like the 'workouts' section if I am looking to work a little more on a specific muscle group. Yet, for me honestly I do feel that the food and dietary section is not useful to me. I am not looking for nutritional advice, im only looking for workout ideas so this to me is not useful. I would advice BetterMe to have a full seperate app just for nutrition and one just for workouts with the possibility of merging data from both apps together if the user wants to. Otherwise, a lot of the data on this is just not useful to some people. I do get the whole concept of being a full plan of food and exercise but thats my experience. Another think I want to point out is the 'do your workouts' section of the Plan page. Some days it recommends walking, other days it recommends a full 25 minute exercise routine -which is exactly what i love about this app and why I subscribed to it. Yet, skme days when i check the 'do your workout' section it says 'today walking' it doesn't make sense. I suggest modifying the Plan page to include under the 'do your workouts' section a 'walking' subsection and an 'exercises' subsection. That way you get to have both new options everyday. more Hello!

        "review": "After my first workout, I deleted the app and decided this wasn’t for me. I have EDS Hypermoble type, which to put simply means my joints and connective tissue are not stable. After my first set of exercises, I’d manage to subluxate both my shoulders and my hips, and was bed bound for several hours. There’s a reason I do exercises under supervision, either from my physical therapist, or when I can afford it, a personal trainer who’s fully aware of my condition. However, I brought up trying the app with my physical therapist, and he was very supportive of the idea of trying wall Pilates at home. He had me redownload the app, and after our session went through the individual exercises with me that I’d had trouble with. (side note, BEST PT ever, I am so happy to have found him.) He helped me find ways to modify them so they were safe for me, or on a couple said “that’s not for you, I don’t feel comfortable with you doing that”. Reminded me to always keep in mind slow and controlled, to not try for full extension since that’s when I tend to over-extend. I’ve now done my third workout, and I’m optimistic. While ideally I’d love to lose weight, right now I’m focusing on feeling better, and more in control of my unpredictable body. I’m excited to see that there are so many different types of workouts. My goal for now is 3 times a week. I still have a lot to explore, and see how if effects and hopefully helps me! more Hello! Thanks for sharing your situation openly. We always recommend consulting your physician before starting any new activity or diet. We are glad you adjusted your plan based on your doctor's advice.

    "appDescription": "iArrest was developed to give healthcare professionals a powerful tool to navigate stressful and challenging cardiac arrest calls. Whether as a Paramedic on scene or as a clinician in hospital, this app can assist in running structured and effective adult cardiac arrest scenarios. Developed by clinicians working in large inner city teaching hospitals, this app takes into consideration the most recent Resuscitation Council (UK) Guidelines 2021. It serves as an aide-memoire for basic tasks that can easily be overlooked in stressful scenarios. iArrest also incorporates a number of timers to assist with rhythm analysis, adrenaline timings and arrest documentation. It will remind the user via audible and visual cues about necessary interventions even if a clinician’s phone is muted. iArrest has been programmed to prevent phones from going into sleep mode, in order to ensure continuous use throughout the arrest. iArrest will record the exact time an important event or an intervention has occurred and present the user with a detailed log of events. These logs can be copied to the clipboard and used for documentation and record keeping. iArrest is currently undergoing extensive testing in simulated and real world scenarios. We are continuously improving and expanding on iArrest’s functionality. Disclaimer: iArrest can not replace sound knowledge in Advance Life Support and should not be used by non-ALS trained clinicians. Use this app at your own risk and always use appropriate clinical judgement. Please familiarise yourself with the functionality of this app before using it in real life scenarios.

The gender selection options, the button to agree to the terms of service and the button to register are not clickable.

I wish there would be a more accurate meter system that operates as soon as you would log-in without lag. More importantly, this app would be more efficient upon an update feature to detail the client’s care assessment and account page categories for when new caregivers get assigned new clients, there would be a more understood process of how this app operates.

Also please make it so I can see the password when putting it in so I don’t have to go back and change the whole thing if one letter or number is wrong. This app is really antiquated and not up to par at all. You should also be able to STAY logged in. If I’m not logging out then I shouldn’t have to keep logging back in daily. The user name and pw should be able to stay there until further notice. Again, another time- consuming unnecessary step that makes everything that much more annoying. Oh and the part where the stupid thing keeps saying you’re “out of range” when your right there in the persons HOUSE!

Sound strange maybe however it’s my truth and I felt the results. I opened my heart and understanding of what these professionals go through to care for their patients that alone was enough to share what they felt. My message is more for patients please show your respect try and understand just how hard they work to get us better. They are your team and they care show them this and they will take it from there. You will get amazing results. Try and understand when the can’t respond it’s not because they don’t care because they do we are not there only patient.

Working with the medical team from Coastal Health, I received restorative back surgery with hopes of restoring my normal life and activities. After initially meeting with Dr Waller I was scheduled for surgery a short time later. Part of the intake process included agreeing to allow a robotic equipment to be used. It is currently 9 days after my surgery and I’m actually feeling better! A great deal of care was taken to reduce the likelihood of infection. Interestingly enough, the resulting cuts were small and included two small puncture wounds that I assumed was used in conjunction with the robotic, mechanical surgeon.

        "review": "This is an amazing app! I paid $37 for the student version and it is perfect. I am lucky to be in a class where we have cadavers but I can’t always go to open lab. So this very useful for visualizing the ligaments and muscles. I love the search feature and being able to add muscles one at a time to the skeleton. I also like that you can hide certain muscles to see those that are deep. The AR feature is great for sketching and the lectures are helpful as well. If you’re in an online anatomy class especially or without access to cadavers this is your best friend and absolutely worth the price. My only critique is that I would love to be able to save certain skeletons that I build. For example after I add all the muscles that move the pectoral girdle to the skeleton I would love to be able to save it to come back to later. And be able to make “playlists” of all my saved models so that they’re easy to find. It’s possible I just haven’t figured this out yet too, still learning the app a little bit. more Hello, Ahmed Ammar. Thank you for taking the time leaving us with a 5-star review.

        "review": "I’ve never paid for an app before but I’m in school to become a Registered Diagnostic Sonographer and I needed something a bit more in-depth, yet, basically “dummy proof” in explaining blood vessel connections and course. If it can help all of these med students then surely it could help me. I wasn’t expecting this app to do that and so much more. Honestly the best $37 ever spent. I don’t feel like I’m memorizing things either; when I gain an understanding of something then it sticks in my head so much better. With my textbooks and class lectures, I’ve just been flash carding everything in my head because alot of the information feels like disjointed information. With this app I feel like relevances has been introduced for the first time. I gave it three stars for one reason only: it keeps crashing. Again, I’m in school for sonography so being able to locate organs from the transverse view is important. I select the cross-section option in order to see the body habitus transversely and the app closes out completely every time. It worked at first - I only discovered the cross-sectional view this morning but now at 5:30 in the evening it no longer works. An incredible bummer because this app is actually the only reason I now understand what my textbooks have been showing me from that specific view. I honestly don’t need to make full use of all of the apps capabilities; the few things I do use it for are now only 50% operative. Please fix the crashing 🙏🏼 more Hello and thank you for your review as well as your in-depth feedback. This sounds like it could be a corrupted download. Please reinstall the app from the App Store.

        "review": "This really is the most comprehensive Anatomy App today. Not only does it include every structure, but it also shows all the forms of movement for every muscle, insertion and origin points and even full courses from experts. That said, the developers need to improve their female Anatomy represetation. Right now you can only see female torso and pelvis. The entire female structure is different than the male, would be great to incide both. Additionally they need to include different skin color options, because diseases present differently on different skin tones. And it's just more inclusive. Make those changes and it would be perfect. Edit: They responded to my question and will have the full female anatomy represented in Winter 2021! Once again the BEST anatomy app. The remaining change for them to make is to add various skin tones to understand how disease presents differently. I'm sure that'll be a quick & easy addition. Thanks developer team! more Hello, thank you for your feedback. We are very much concerned about the lack of a full female model. That is why we have developed the most accurate, most detailed female pelvis and female thorax on the market. We are striving to generate a true representation of the female anatomy and not merely a feminized version of the male anatomy as is currently most common in the 3D anatomy market. We hope to release a full female model in the Winter of 2021. Thank you. - 3D4Medical. more"

I'm trying to say i need an option that will inform the device that i won’t change my invisalign tray to the next one for a reason. Right now i am having problems with my teeth, so my orthodontist had to adjust one of my invisalign trays and now i can change until a certain date. It would also be helpful if they changed hot the invisalign on and off clock worked. Wouldn’t it be easier if you could just press a button that tells the app your taking it off and when it is more than a certain time off it reminds you to put it back on. Also can it reset, instead of saying you have had if off for 15 total hours since you started just reset and show like a chart of how many hours you have taken it off for each day.

Also I wish it would time the trays inside the bobble wash, I always worry on under doing the time and afraid of over doing it, don’t want to wash them. Also would like to have a way to take a pic of my teeth inside of my mouth. Then I can see the teeth are moving. I would like to have a comparison on the pictures to see how many shades my teeth had turned after brushing my teeth so many times more per day. My other wish add on the app a section Called “ News of my mouth” ( lol) like a diary where I can write all the notable changes I had seen since I started to wear my trays. ( less headaches, losing weight, less night snoring etc). I really think that your app can improve. Also if I could take a profile pic. Can you measure how my jaw it’s moving and I m losing my double chin? Would be nice if I can have that in my app log. And pictures. Last, I would love to have the information send to my dentist, so she can read my progress when she’s eating her lunch or just checking the pictures of my daily teeth report, so she can be on the loop. She would be trill if she can check her patients without me a having to make an appointment with her. Lastly if the app can take a pic of my trays and later on review them and see that They are no damage, that is would be fantastic!

        "review": "My doctor AND Invisalign corporate recommend aligners be worn 20-22 hours per day to be compliant. Yet, your app’s user is only deemed compliant with nothing less than 22 hours of wear. Why have you taken it upon yourselves to disregard two hours of the day the manufacturer and board certified orthodontists direct as compliant? Not only have you sent this message to patients, but you go further to not allow any manual adjustment or override of your incorrect definition of compliant hours. It’s easy on the coding end to let users have a choice of hours per day to set as compliant in consultation with their doctor. Your app is designed to interact with the patient’s doctor’s office. So if you can’t offer the designation of 20 hours, how is this really helpful for an orthodontist or their staff to quickly glance at a patient’s history through this app and all they see is a non-compliant when in fact the patient has worn the aligners for 20 hours or more? Don’t you think they are frustrated and feel it’s not purposeful for them? Do you understand how demotivating it is for the user/patient to see that their non-compliant status every day for weeks/months when they have been within 20 to 22 hours? You are doing this on purpose, why I’m not sure. But you are taking the user’s joy and support by not using the professional guidelines. more Thanks for sharing with us how the app could be better for you.

        "review": "This app is so good! If you have any uncontrollable pain, or even a persistent discomfort, this app can help you. There is a wealth of knowledge that helps you understand that your brain is what tells us that we have pain. All pain originates in our brain - this does NOT mean the pain is in our heads, but that our brains generate the amount of pain we feel. We can also change our brain’s response to something that has caused us pain, and therefore reduce the pain. Knowledge is power, and in this case it is a scientifically proven, therapeutic way to reduce pain. I also love the recovery stories and expert interviews. There is guided meditation to help you relax (not my favorite because I don’t like her voice - I use a different exercise app), writing activities, and brain training. The only thing I wish were improved was that there would be more education and brain training into opportunities. For me, these alone helped get rid of my pain. It also reduced or eliminated other uncomfortable sensations I was feeling in my body (e.g., a really weird metallic/sour taste in my mouth I experienced for 9 months with no other medical explanation). I really think it was stress, and this app took it away for me!

        "review": "I am 57 years old, and I’ve been suffering from back pain since I was in my teens. For many years as a teenager I saw a physical therapist to help with my back pain. Unfortunately, it only helped a little. I live a very healthy lifestyle, and about 3 to 5 times a year my back will go out, and I will be completely debilitated for several days. Sometimes I am completely unable to even get off the floor or get out of bed as the pain is unbearable. The only thing I have found that helps is to continually exercise. Over the years I’ve consulted with many surgeons that said I was not a candidate for surgery. A few years ago I started getting epidural injections that would minimize the frequency of my severe lower back spasms. Of course I don’t like getting the injections and I haven’t had one in over 14 months. 2 1/2 months ago, I started using the Curable app and I’ve been 90% pain-free. I still have experienced back spasms, but unlike previously when I would be bedridden for a day or two and have to take pain pills and anti inflammatories and miss work for a few days, now my spasms go away within about a minute and so does the pain. I’m blown away by the results and am enjoying the process along the way.

I was laid up in bed for 10 days not only with the pain of my congenital injury, but also with side effects of prednisone which led to excruciating muscle spasms in my quads that forced me completely out of commission because of the pain. I was on hydrocodone, but I was able to wean off of it by using this app to change my relationship with the pain and to breathe into a different mindset. Just this morning, I woke up with my back spasming, and I immediately went into fear mode. But I put on a meditation from this app, and I was able to calm my mind and my body, and therefore the pain has subsided considerably and I am able to move and function today. I also just completed the journal, and it helped calm my perspective on what lies ahead for me. I love that all of the lessons are research-based with valid scientific evidence. I hold a Master’s Degree in Kinesiology with a focus on Integrative Wellness, and so I understand the research that is relevant to this app since I have studied it previously. Even with that “logical” background, I am human and can still spiral into overwhelm and fear when the pain flares up.

        "review": "I have owned hearing aids in the past. Purchased high quality aids about 15 years ago and could never get accustomed to them. Found myself not using them due to their amplification of all sounds around you. I then later tried a lower cost hearing units and they did the same. So for the last 7 years I didn’t use hearing aids. My hearing was very difficult when trying to have conversations. I decided that my quality of life had to improve not just for me but those around me. I hope that technology had improved. I wanted top professional help so I went to highly recommended audiologist. I was fitted with some great hearing aids that I forget I’m wearing them. And my hearing has much improved during conversations in various noisy locations or just listening to the TV. You owe it to yourself and the ones around you to find a hearing aid if you are having difficulty with hearing certain words and pitches. And you can go walking and answer the telephone or play music grime your smartphone. Love them. Glad I made the decision to improve my life. more Thank you so much for sharing your experience with us and taking the time to leave an excellent rating. We really appreciate!

Their “privacy policy does not apply to the personal information they collect”. That is taken from paragraph 1 of their policy. Paragraph 2 allows then to collect personal information directly and automatically and third party, including social media. Paragraph 3 allows them to share my personal information with companies that market with them, for analytics with their affiliates. Paragraph 5 allows their tracking on any Facebook, Google, and LinkedIn, etc., for what I view. If I deny their use of “cookies”, information that take to “better benefit me”, and I configure “DNT (do not track)”, their system is set up to ignore my request, allowing them to track signals from my browsers and mobile devices. In some states, I can request deletion of files twice a year, free of charge, but by then, damage is done. You cannot undo what has been shared. I could go on, but please read everything. They escape legalities by informing us what they do, so we are then helpless. My information is taken directly from their website. I encourage you to read and think twice, is it really worth it, taking advantage of patients during COVID, when there is no other choice? more Hi there, I’d like to address your concerns with our Privacy Policy. To clarify, our Privacy Policy does apply to the Personal Information we collect from our customers, but doesn’t apply to clients’ Private Health Information (PHI) stored in customer accounts.

We do not sell, or disclose client data to third-party platforms in any capacity and take great precautions to ensure that our team is properly trained to handle PHI, when necessary to help customers with account specific questions. The Personal Information we reference in the Privacy Policy only applies to the information customers disclose when creating an account, reach out to us for assistance with their account, information we request when verifying a customer’s identity, or if they decide to interact with us through one of our social networks. The collection of Personal Information is used to directly service our customers, and internally analyze how we can best help our users and enhance our product.

I’ve have always had therapist’s the same therapist for up to 10 years. I am 60 years old and can see and feel her compassion. And the hardest part is that she will be leaving in December. I think Next Chapter is a great service for those with mental illness. I would like to continue therapy. With a new student after Lauren is gone.

I know there’s not many people there in the morning, but they block you out from that so fast. But yet you can still schedule at 7:30 when tons of people are there and coming in. So it’s next to impossible for me to donate twice a week when I can only schedule an appointment one at a time, and on that short notice I can’t get a spot in the morning. ^^^^^ And I’m confused why it even blocks you out of scheduling at that time when less people are there than at other times that you can schedule. ^^^^^ It’s just a tremendously packed place at this location, would love to be able to come in and get it done but this confusing method of “scheduling appointments” that assumes you have all the free time in the world is very oddly done.

U get to the place and there is always a 1-3 hour wait BEFORE sign in. Because “someone called in sick “. Because of that u have to click early early times to get in. Sadly most of them are gone. Like say 9 am. U click 9 am and u might get in but not your spouse. So she goes at 9:10. There is a 10 minute grace period to sign in. Can’t be 11 minutes early or late to sign in( at the facility) now say u get there at 8:40. Since it’s a 30 minute drive. U leave a cushion. U try to change appointment. U have to CANCEL old one. And click to see if there is availability. Hopefully there is. If not u just lost you appointment. You can get around this by talking to the receptionist there “hey can u see if there is something earlier since we are already here “.

Being able to see the whole month to schedule your appointment was much nicer. In the end it doesn’t really matter because the line to get tested is usually a half hour, then you wait in another line a half hour to get a chair, then you wait again for them to catch up and stick a needle in you. My scheduled last appointment took 2 hours to complete. I only need 45 minutes to give plasma so the rest is all waiting. Why even have an appointment? Must be like the airlines and overbook seats.

        "review": "Edit: thanks for the response. Do you have any plans on adding health app syncing? I really like this app. I have probably only one problem thus far. I also use the CPAP that this company makes so I have the app that tells me how I’m doing with that as well. But I wish that they could make them one app since they both measure different things. This one uses the sound waves/sonar and the other one tells you how your use of the CPAP went. But they are not the same. Some nights I take off the CPAP without thinking and then it stops tracking my sleep even though I’m still asleep. Would be nice to have both wrapped up into one app (set your wake time and have it start tracking your sleep when you start the CPAP) and get both scores with the premium membership included because you bought the machine and continue to buy the supplies. Just a thought. I’m still looking for one place to track my sleep and teach me how to do it better. The 2 apps come close. more Hi Bobby, I wanted to update you and let you know that we are now able to write information to the Apple health kit. If you download the most recent version of the SleepScore app you will notice the sleep data now being transferred. more"

        "review": "I’ve been using the app for about 4 months now. I have ME/CFS along with fibromyalgia and arthritis. When I first started using the app I noticed I was getting less than 30min of REM sleep a night and not enough deep sleep either. When I was able to get more REM sleep I noticed I felt much better and energy is improved overall. So as I’ve been using the app to increase my REM and deep sleep, my overall functioning has gotten better. Of course it’s not a cure for my chronic illness but has made a big difference! And for anyone with ME/CFS, you know that little bit better functioning is actually huge! It’s relatively low cost, the free version has worked fine but I paid for the subscription to save my data. It’s surprisingly accurate too. I can see when I wake up what kind of day I will be having now based on the data and knowing my body. The sleep score doesn’t always mean I feel well rested/alert because of my individual health issues but I can tell if I have enough sleep including rem and deep sleep that it will correlate to better functioning. more Thank you very much for your 5-star review!!! Glad you like it! :) more"

        "review": "Liking this app a lot after about a week and a half of use. It’s a little picky about how/where you have it placed so it can “detect” you and track throughout the night, but once you find a good position close enough to you it’s good. My only real feedback I would give right now is that there doesn’t seem to be a way to adjust the volume on my device in regard to the smart alarm feature. I really like this feature and I feel it has reduced my grogginess upon waking, but the app seems to have a default volume level for the alarm that is significantly louder than it needs to be, especially considering how close your device is in order to track your sleep! My husband is not usually woken up by my alarms but this one is so loud that it has woken him up a few times, and when I try to turn it down on my phone, the app moves the volume level right back up. Maybe this is just a bug that could be fixed? I would definitely recommend this app as it does have a lot of really good features and is a really good learning tool, but it does still have just some general bugs to be worked out. more Hi, thank you for providing your feedback. We are so happy to hear that you are liking the app, and that you have found the optimal setup for your room. We will be sure to pass along your feedback about the smart alarm volume to the team for improvement. If you have any other questions or concerns, please reach out to Support@sleepscorelabs.com and a customer service specialist will be in contact. Sleep well! more"

To me, surgery is a last resort. Insurance provided the opportunity to participate in Hinge Health physical therapy as a starting alternative. Knowing that physical therapy can make a huge difference I signed up. Hinge Health provided an excellent solution and I can participate fully right here at home. HH provided targeted physical therapy in an easy to follow format that allows me work at my own pace while strengthening and rebuilding weak areas.

Building up your strength slowly, with the help of your coach and the exercises customized to your needs can make all the difference long term. HH provides everything you need including your own online coach to cheer you on and monitor your progress. I have been using this program, sometimes not as much as I should, and recently realized that I have achieved some core strengths and abilities that I have never been able to do, even when I was younger and in top shape.

I like the access to both a therapist who you can have telehealth appointments with to discuss individualizing your plan and a health coach to check in and encourage.

The videos they provide are great and the articles are very helpful and informative. I tell all my doctors about this program and how it’s helped me. I used to have urinary frequency and urgency and pudendal nerve pain affecting me when sitting. Where I used to have to go to the bathroom every hour each morning, with the urgency being painful, I can go three hours in between and the signal to go is not painful. The nerve pain that would flare during sitting periods has greatly reduced and I have easy stretches throughout the workday to do to help. Many days I’m not bothered by it even with long days at the computer.

Once you’re there, select all your imaging, and share them to your email address. Now that you have an Ambra account, and all your records are available through your Ambra account, all of your records will be available through this app. Note: After each new imaging, you’ll need to access Ambra through your health service account, through the Ambra portal, and then it’ll also be available.

The ONE thing I would change is adding the option to choose from different expiration times. It’s stuck on freezer=3 months and deep freezer=6 months when really they would be good for much longer. Like 3-6months and 6-12 months! Other than that, I love it! So 4 stars :) more Hi there, the app does this!

It’s so convenient to just look at my phone for a quick reminder of how long it’s been since he ate or how long he’s been asleep rather than opening the app each time. I also just had a wonderful experience with the app’s tech support. The widgets had frozen on me and were not updating so I wrote the developers an email detailing the issue. Didn’t really expect to get a reply but I was so desperate for what had become my favorite feature to work again that I took a chance. To my surprise, they not only responded to let me know they’d be looking into it but also emailed me when they released an update that would hopefully correct the issue!

        "review": "This app is gold. It has all the common activities you’d want to track for your baby done simply, beautifully, intuitively, and without fuss. I love that you can be as specific or as simple as you want, other apps won’t let you save an activity without filing out all the fields. As a second time mom, there’s plenty of times where the toddler distracts me from logging right away and getting some info entered later in the day is better than none! As others have mentioned, typing things in or just hitting start/stop is intuitive and easy - I’m never saying “how do I do this?” with this app! BUT what makes this app really special is the ability to track activities for mom. With my first baby, the baby blues quickly spiraled into Postpartum Depression because keeping myself hydrated, fed, and showered was easy to forget. While babies cry to remind you something’s forgotten, Mama bodies will just keep grinding until you’re so depleted you can’t get out of bed. Tracking myself along with baby in one place is simple and beautifully executed! There’s even the ability to track mom sleep (not that you have much control over it) but when you “wake up” from a night of 2 hour stretches b/c of a growth spurt, it’s easy to see why you feel foggy and short fused! Without a doubt I’m a better mamma because of the insight I get from this app! more Thank you so much for your glowing review! We're thrilled to hear that you find our app intuitive, easy to use, and helpful in tracking both your baby's activities and your own. We're glad that the app has made your life as a second-time mom much easier. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to let us know. more"

        "review": "I’m not even one for being on my phone much, but I’ve got to say it: the convenience and utility offered by Nara, being able to glance at timers and a calendar for a quick visual overview of where your baby is at, is so incredibly helpful by taking the stress out of having to otherwise keep track of everything manually in your head, while still having all of life’s other demands on your plate. Multiple caretakers also benefit greatly: my wife and I, even grandma for example; anyone added to the app can mark changes, feedings, naps, and more, while anyone with their phone can also see the updates in real time. It makes coordination so much easier. Lastly, you can see from the calendar view and other metrics how your baby grows and changes over time, to include their natural rhythms, when & how often they’re hungry, how & when they need naps and sleep, etc., to the degree that you can easily predict what needs are coming up next and how to fold them into your plans. TL;DR: this app greatly makes light the work of a parent’s job in scheduling and timekeeping for their baby. Eventually you’ll outgrow the need for it, but in the demanding early days especially, it is so massively handy and a habit worth investing the time into using! more We truly appreciate your detailed feedback and are glad to hear how the app has helped to streamline and simplify the demanding task of parenting in those early days!

I’d like to fix a typo and cannot change the name of the mole. -cannot set photo date. I do appreciate that you can load previously taken photos.

The ability to get treatment for my depression in an easy and friendly process with insanely affordable prices due to no insurance, I was able to get Depression medicine for a year for $350. That’s absolutely fantastic, less than $1 a day. All of this while still maintaining great communication and doing follow ups & LISTENING to their patients. And while doing this I was able to utilize some of their other products that are things that many of us ignore but Hims makes it so easy & stress free to get these very helpful treatments that tradition doctors make such a painful process to do so we just never go. help with depression, Better sex, better hair, BETTER LIFE! Even anti aging products as well to keep you looking and feeling great. I am very thankful for Hims and can’t even put a price tag on how helpful it has been for me, especially as someone with no medical insurance. If you have not tried Hims yet it’s definitely worth a shot to try and the agents and doctors really are helpful and do follow ups & allow you to manage your treatment and ACTUALLY LISTEN TO YOU! more Hey, Thanks so much for sharing your experience with us!

You tell them what you’re interested in, they ask you questions and if you qualify based on your answers then they send you the meds you ask for. If you want to change your prescription be it a different medication or a different quantity you can literally get on the app and it’s stupid easy. If you don’t have the bread to cover it at the moment you can just “snooze” the prescription, and then if you end up with the money later you can simply click “refill now” like I just did and you get your script soon after. I honestly don’t pay attention to how long it takes to ship but it seems fairly quick. I don’t remember ever feeling like I was waiting forever for them. Oh, and also you can chat with your medical provider at anytime though the app and I’ve never waited longer than a few hours for a response. Under normal circumstances you just get your little brown box in the mail and you don’t have to mess with anything but enjoying feeling better or giving it to your wife. The only negative I have… is that it seems expensive. I’m not really knowledgeable but it seems very expensive for the sort of thing it is.

Make a pile of phone calls and since my Fax machine isn’t working at the moment have to find a nearest Fax machine. It would be trillions easier if I or any physician who needed the report had access to it. I’m sure there are a lot of other reports like x-rays and results of other tests like CT scans and MRI’s were available. The problem is, either the Patients moves on or the Doctor moves on and it would be greatly helpful. Thank You, Darlene Radke.

Blood work may be interesting for the patient to look at and maybe ask questions but things like Surgical Notes, CT scans, and MRI’s may make a big difference in future care. Also, for me to just request the OP note is help;ful to the doctor, but what if he decides something else might be helpful and if he had old records he might not have to repeat them. more"

        "review": "I took my almost 2 year old here this past weekend for a head injury. After hitting his head on the wall and actually breaking through the drywall, my toddler was a bit wobbly. His regular pediatrician office was closed but they told me over the phone to take him to urgent care asap to get him looked at for possible concussion. This was our first time visiting this office, I really loved the environment and all the colorful walls and cute designs. It definitely made my toddler feel comfortable. The staff was very helpful and friendly during check in and filling in paper work since it was our first time. The doctor was really nice and my son was comfortable with him. The visit overall was the fastest visit I have ever had! My son is totally fine. But I will be honest, after reading several reviews, I do wish the doctor would’ve taken a little more time checking my son for a possible concussion. I’m not a doctor so I will be honest, I don’t really know what to check for, but all he did was check his eyes with a little light. Is that enough?? I’m not sure. I did ask a few questions, and the doctor answered all my questions politely. We will be coming back here for emergency visits. Hopefully the doctor takes his time when needed :) but no complaints here! :) more"

I woke up a few days ago, figured I had a sinus infection brewing but decided eh, you don’t know what you’re talking about. Just ignore it. Saturday morning rolls around, Come to find out, I knew what I was talking about. Pounding headache, sinus pain, can’t swallow. I was a mess, after sleeping the day away, I woke up at 530 and was sure I was screwed. When I remembered Solv! I logged in and there was an appointment available 12 minutes later. I signed a virtual form, verified my info and then saw the angel of a provider who listened to my symptoms agreed I had a sinus infection and sent me a script for antibiotics and a few other feel better meds! I was able to wake up schedule visit and pick up my script within 36 minutes. On a Saturday evening. I’m a longtime doctors office avoider, so the fact that everything was so simple and so easy was fantastic. Not having to leave my bed except to get my meds was even better. For anybody who doubts telemedicine or it’s abilities let me tell you….Solv is the way of the future, don’t knock it til you try it!! 5 stars all the way, thanks again Solv! more"

Booking an appointment that day and not having to take a blind guess on when’s gonna be the best time with the shortest wait time to drop in cause you dread how your irritable 3 year old is going to get through a potentially less than desirable long wait time, and then I wonder how I’m gonna make it dealing with him! I’m SOOO grateful to have made my appointment earlier that day. I have already been a huge fan of the Woodcreek family, but it just got so much better thanks to Solv! Knowing now that I can go online, book an Urgent Care appointment (if I can’t get an appointment with anyone that day and it’s not a life threatening emergency), and that they honestly will honor my appointment time ( which in my case it was putting me in front of a dozen other people who were there before me as a walk-in), the whole experience from start to finish was extremely fast, easy, and took all of that dreaded hectic chaos and out of the equation that would’ve been a nightmare no doubt otherwise. And it left a big chunk of my day to me instead of waiting in a clinic for hours trying to please a unhappy toddler. more Hi there, and thank you for taking the time to leave a thoughtful, and thorough review. We appreciate you sharing your experience and we're thrilled that booking ahead helped you and your little one spend less time waiting for the visit! more"

I thought the problems I read in the other reviews were probably not going to be an issue because my sugar is pretty stable. No hi-low alarms for me… well I hate to say that alarm still goes off randomly and at the most inopportune times! I was in a meeting and got a little too far away from my phone. By the time I got to get into the app and stop it, the alarm had gone off 4 times! And when I use the word alarm, I mean it. It is very loud, ear-piercing and startling, not just annoying. That’s great if it’s saving somebody’s life, but utterly ridiculous for me at this point. That being said, in setting you can (supposedly) shut off the alarm for when your Bluetooth cannot connect, like when you’re too far from your phone. So I did that, but it still alarms sometimes for no good reason. No trouble with my sugar, and no identifiable reason for an alarm. !_! Problem is, I’m stuck. At least for the month, since I already paid for two new sensors. And one more thing, this one is reading consistently higher than the other one did, and I have not changed my very strict diet. I know it’s not accurate enough to make treatment decisions based on this sensor, but it’s still disturbing. We’ll see what my next blood test says. In the meantime I just keep using this sensor and hope it doesn’t startle me into having a wreck while driving. RANT OVER more Thanks for the comment.

        "review": "As someone who is blind, this is a great app, but I haven’t even used it for 24 hours and the alarms are annoying which isn’t that bad because you can just turn them off. however, the real problem is the fact that you need to constantly run the app in order to receive those alarms and there’s no way to run the app’s alarm feature in the background or more specifically, while the app is closed. I don’t know if it’s normal for the sensor to lose its signal with your phone while the app is closed but it makes no sense why the app has to run to stay connected to the sensor and receive alarms and within the first 24 hours of attaching the sensor to my arm, it lost its signal 3 times Plus, having the app always running will just drain your device’s battery quicker which I don’t appreciate due to the fact that I have an older iPhone model. you need to fix the app so that you don’t need it to constantly run just to be able to use the alarms. I mean most GPS apps allow and give you the option to use your location while the app itself is closed. So, why can’t you just receive the alarms while the app is closed? It’s so annoying that I have to charge my phone even more now because of this app draining my battery while open. more Thanks for the comment. We appreciate hearing from you. more"

        "review": "This app is supposed to help improve my blood sugar by constantly monitoring it, but it actually makes it worse. Let me tell you why. Unless you turn the sensoring off all together, it would obnoxiously allow. I understand it’s for my health, but I can not have this thing beeping and going off so annoyingly all the time. I have work, I go to church, I need to sleep. There are lots of places where I can’t just have this thing beeping. You do realize that if I’m high, and I do a correction it takes time for my blood sugar to come back up. But it’ll keep going off, it’ll keep saying I’m high even though I already corrected it. So I just turn it off and then forget to turn it on and miss being more accurate in my blood sugar because this thing is so annoying. Me and both my 2 diabetic friends have talked about it, we all turn it off until we need to test again. If I got a nice silent notification that my blood sugar is high, I would correct it. Vs not knowing at all for an extra 3 hours because I turned it off. There NEEDS to be a setting to turn off the sound and still get notifications. Stop trying to control us so much that this thing has to beep so loud and so obnoxiously when we’re not in target and just make it like a text message so we can choose wether it’s completely silent, vibrates, or alarms. Because I promise you’re doing more harm than help. more We're sorry to hear this. Please contact our Customer Care team at 1-855-632-8658 so we can better assist. more"

They received it without issue. I got my test results from a sleep doctor in less than 12 hours and a full personalized recommendation. It was easy to understand. I requested my prescription and it was password protected and emailed to me, again within 12 hours. I really can’t speak enough to the level of care I’ve received. A few tips. If you follow the instructions to the letter, you won’t have any issues. Go step by step. If at any point the device isn’t working, contact Lofta. Their customer service is awesome. Be patient with the technology. Make sure it’s connected (green light) and that the watch is not too tight. Attach the sensor on your chest with some medical tape.

I’ve seen a lot of bad reviews, far as their finger being sore (unbearably). As a 6 foot 300 pound man with bigger than normal fingers, I did not have the same experience as most. Am not telling you your finger won’t be a little sore when you take it off, it was sore for maybe 45 minutes but it was nothing to get on here and write a bad review about it. After taking the test, my results were in and I had an appointment scheduled the next day to talk with someone. If you or someone that can follow directions fairly well this test is for you. If you take it upon yourself thinking you know best with every situation, you should probably go and see a specialist. Best thousand of dollars I’ve saved yet! more"

The initial settings for minute ventilation (tidal volume (VT) and respiratory rate (RR)) will be proposed. The VT will be determined according to the predicted body weight, the body temperature and the type of patient (medical or surgical). VT/RR combinations for different targets of VT (3 to 10 mL / kg PBW will be provided, settings from 6 to 8 mL/kg PBW will be preferred). Educational texts are proposed to help other settings (PEEP and FiO2) in the different care contexts. ‘’Optimizing settings’’ is covered in another separate tab. Will provide calculation of several parameters (alveolar ventilation, dead space…) based on the patient’s data, ventilator settings and arterial blood gases results. In addition interpretations will be provided for Oxygenation, Ventilation (CO2) and Lung protection. In another separate tab ‘’Tools&Calculators’’, several tools are provided: -Impact of the instrumental is explained in details. Minute ventilation and alveolar ventilation (minute ventilation - dead space ventilation) are calculated. The physiological dead space is calculated according to published formulas linked to the predicted body weight of the patients, the instrumental dead space (linked to the volumes of the endotracheal tubes, connections, heat and moisture exchangers) is calculated. The impact of reducing dead space on several parameters is calculated (gain in alveolar ventilation, gain in reduction in tidal volume (and associated reduction in plateau pressure),or respiratory rate with constant alveolar ventilation) - Different Calculators (P/F ratio from SpO2, PBW…) -Links to several additional tools (Quick Reference Respiratory Care Card; O2 demand calculator, Recruitment to Inflation Ratio…) In addition to the measurements of these different parameters, several educational texts are accessible in the application to understand what dead space is during mechanical ventilation, what is instrumental dead space, what is the impact of dead space in function of ventilation settings and possible gains. These calculations and descriptions concern ventilated adult patients, in the emergency room, intensive care units and in the operating room. The VentilO application was developed with the help of several mechanical ventilation experts. The mobile application is trilingual (English, French and Spanish), based on the users settings. more",

Yes you can adjust the goal metrics but what if I want to change how it’s configured? 2) There are two seemingly “default” goals (mood and energy). I didn’t see how to delete them, but rather “hide them”. Hiding them made them disappear into somewhere I wouldn’t know where to look if I wanted them shown again. 3) Metric scale doesn’t have ability to count 0 (therefore making something like counting number of drinks, with 0 being the goal, impossible. 4) Even the feedback form in the app seems faulty. Tried to use it but every time I tried to press return for a new bullet the form disappeared. Unsure if it was submitting or just closing out. 5) The graphs are a good start but I’d like to see a daily chart as well, not just weekly or monthly. For a paid app this just falls way short. Canceled my trial. more Hi Ctelle1234 - thank you for your feedback, we really appreciate your thorough review of our app. We're constantly updating our service to ensure the experience our users are getting is always evolving and improving.

The updated management guidelines aim to: • Allow for a more complete and precise estimation of risk • Provide more appropriate intervention for high-risk individuals (detect and treat more precancer) • Recommend less intervention for low-risk individuals (decrease testing and treatment that won’t prevent cancer and may cause reproductive harm) • Allow for the future addition of new risk modifiers and screening and management technologies See https://www.asccp.org/UserGuide for tips on using the app. more",

There is no ability to get in line before others who may have just walked in. In reality the center is completely walk in basis. If I schedule a time but now the center is showing a long wait time a notice should be pushed letting me know. The donor360 questions should be an integrated part of the app not taking me to a website. That is rather annoying. I have to log into separate websites to check payment on my card and any bonuses received. Technically this is now a 3rd login. Push notifications regarding center status would be extremely helpful. I filled out questions at home drive to center only to find it full of people who could not check in and systems appeared to be down. Had I known there was an issue I would not have driven to the center instead I would have planned around the centers issues. It wasn’t worth my time to wait for an unknown amount of time waiting for system to be up and running and all the other people waiting at 7:45am to be checked in. more"

Then I started as a new donor in June I was to receive 1000 for that month but the 1st 2weeks I was shorted on 4 donations. So that bad odds. I’ve called several times to try and allow them to correct the issues. I’ve emailed. I never got anyone to correct it. Center claims they don’t do back pay? You shorted me like $200. I’m sure your making plenty off the fluids that I donate. That is bad for business and I don’t trust the center to pay me to recruit my friends anymore. It’s sad that your doing it to help people but the center that’s collecting the plasma is shorting the donors. Can’t make it right with you and don’t even give you a reason. I guess they don’t care about nothing but the money they make off your plasma. Nothing you can do but stop donating and people that need the medication will pay even more for it because we all know the less their is the more it costs. more"

I called customer service and the representative and I believe got confused with my problem and told me there was no way to fix it. She then started yelling aggressively with me. She pretended she couldn’t hear me and hung up. I called again and another representative said she couldn’t do anything about it . I asked to speak with a supervisor, and she said I would get the same answer, but she wouldn’t mind transferring me. Why does she have to make such a bad comment? Why can’t she just transfer me like I asked. After a brief whole time, she answered the phone again, and apologized and said something can be done about it after all! So while she was processing my bonus again the call dropped ! I never received my bonus and me and my wife stopped going for good. On top of all this I never received 2500 points I was supposed to have. BPL plasma and Grifols pay more anyways. And Grifols has WAY shorter lines than CSL.

However, it pretty much says every result is concerning or has a high cancer risk. For example I have benign seborrheic keratosis on my arm that I’ve had since I was a teenager and it said my cancer risk was 85% and I needed to run to a dermatologist. Even a quick google search will tell you seborrheic keratosis are not pre-cancerous. Yet, they say it is a huge cancer risk. They also diagnosed me with lentigo on my arm saying it was most likely (74%) precancerous when Lentigo is, by the books, harmless but can resemble dangerous lesions. Then they try to get you to pay for a “dermatologist” of theirs opinion. Just go to the doctor or monitor your own skin and go with your instinct. This will only make anxiety flair. more We are sorry that you did not like our application.

My cut has since healed and was nothing more than a small bump. I can understand the principle of overestimating these things, but the fact that this app charges you for what is more likely than not to be a misdiagnosis is disgusting. If you're really concerned about a spot on your skin, don't bother with this and just go straight to your physician. more Thank you for sharing your experience.

I don’t mind eating things I like on a regular basis but some additional options added on would help with variety. Some Recipes with cauliflower in them, especially as a crust for a pizza, for instance, would be nice if they meet the requirements. Also, a feature that would let me build a meal and see its micronutrients balance would be nice. Five stars would come if the recipes would expand. more Thank you for your thoughtful feedback!

        "review": "I went ahead and subscribed to this app for six months, but I wish I had tried out the app first. It's hard to log food, logging my exercise results in a double entry on Apple+. I wish I could just enter numbers instead of being forced to scroll. I can't find out what things like \"quinoa salad\" contain so I can't judge which selection is most correct to what I ate for dinner. I can't enlarge the page to full screen on my iPad, which is annoying because it would work better for me if I could. It's not the worst health app I've ever used, bit it is definitely on the lower end of the list. I likely won't renew. Update: I've been using the app for about a week. I'm taking off a star. This app is ridiculously difficult to use. Worse, it freezes up all the time. The inability to enter custom numbers is a huge problem. The app is awkward and clunky, and fully half or more of what I log is likely inaccurate because there is almost no customizing available. If I was simply dieting, this wouldn't be a huge problem (although annoying nonetheless), but I'm using this app because I'm prediabetic, and accuracy is vital. I'm not getting what I need out of this app. I'm moving on to something else. Two stars is generous. more Hello there, Thank you for taking the time to share your detailed feedback. We are sorry to hear that your experience hasn't been as smooth as expected. We understand your frustrations and are constantly working to improve the app. We're planning to release a new feature soon to make food logging super easy.

We truly appreciate your input and hope to better meet your needs in the future. Best regards, Emma. more"

It truly helps keep track of my health symptoms throughout the day so I can find patterns and make adjustments to my daily routine in order to better my overall future health. I also love that it communicates with the Apple Health app. It’s very user friendly and easy to use. My only complaint is when I manually enter my body temperature on my Apple Watch, it doesn’t actually record it in the app. Maybe it’s a glitch or something… It DOES, however, keep track of my wrist temperature whenever I’m wearing my watch, so that’s another helpful feature. It also keeps track of my heart rate and blood oxygen levels (newer models of the Apple Watch have this feature) throughout the day and night, which is VERY important for me to keep track of due to my current health status. In summary, it’s an excellent app for tracking symptoms in one place, so you can easily find patterns and share with your doctors and caregivers. more Thank you for your feedback! ❤️ You motivate us every month and every day!

Please allow for different volumes and allow for vibration alerts too. I understand that it’s a liability if the alarm isn’t heard, but the fact that there’s no way to lower the volume makes me uncomfortable with using it at work/in class. I can’t have this beeping when I’m attending a lecture or taking an exam. This really needs to be changed in order for diabetics to make this part of their daily life. This is my only critique as if 14 days of use. It is an amazing tool that relieves stress immensely. After 20 years of pricking my finger, it’s incredible to not constantly have to use traditional meter testing. While I still do use my meter everyday, the frequency with which I test is down by about 60%. Before Libre 3, I tested 12X a day. Now it’s around 5X. Also, the comfort of having truly accurate sensor readings upon simply opening my app is life changing. Thank you for giving diabetics some sense of normalcy and a break from the relentless guessing game of blood sugars. Even with proper management, some things just can’t be controlled. The Libre 3 has eased some anxieties and given me comfort I never thought I would have. Just please fix the alarm system. I want to enjoy this 24/7, not just when I am comfortable with a loud alarm going off in the privacy of my own home. more Thank you for your comment.

        "review": "Update. After using for six weeks the third sensor ended in the middle of the night, cutting out about three hours of use, based on when I applied the last, and then the app froze on “you must be an adult”. After applying a new sensor, the app remained frozen. Tried turning on and off my phone. That didn’t help. I had to uninstall the app and reinstall, losing all my history data. Here’s my original review. No changes since my review: You can’t turn off certain alarms in this version, so the app keeps waking me up. The problem is I’m a side sleeper so the sensor regularly loses connectivity or senses an inaccurate low reading. I have resorted to turning off my Bluetooth in order to get any sleep. When turning on my Bluetooth in the morning it won’t connect unless I reopen the app and wait three minutes. Thankfully, the sensor seems to have some built in memory, so it generally charts my nighttime numbers once I reconnect. I also dislike the fact that I can no longer take an immediate reading. It’s nice that the app reads the sensor every few minutes, but sometime you need to know right away and don’t have the luxury of staring at your phone for a few minutes in order to get a current reading. Fix these few things and it will be a great app. Not sure what can be done about the inaccurate readings when sleeping on my side, but I can live with that since I’m pretty consistent with my night numbers. more We'd like to follow up with this.

I work nights (10pm-6am) and it’s a little annoying to have to change the filter every time I open the app. It sets to 150 miles away and I have to change that every time as well. If that can be changed to where it keeps your filters rather than resetting every time, I would be fulfilled with the app. Or also when premium shifts pop up, if you can choose in the app to be notified about only the shifts that you want to be notified about. Ex. I work 10pm-6am, then I can set only premium shifts that pop up for that time as my notifications since the premium shifts show up aaallllll day (while I’m trying to sleep during the day). more Hi there!

        "review": "To all my health care professionals, BEWARE. Do not go to Brooklyn Queens Nursing home in brooklyn. They have needs on shiftkey and require nurses and cna’s to work 1 orientation shift with them. I requested it and they approved it 3 days later, 4 days before the scheduled shift. When myself and another healthcare professional arrived, the scheduler (the one in charge of booking everyone) greeted us and then asked for our paperwork. Why? Esp when we are cleared on the platforms to work. (Drug test, physicals and licensure) after that she had us wait about a hr and half to gathet the forms and said we needed to go Home because thats not how they do things and “shiftkey knows not to book anyone without them calling and meeting with admin before hand” which is a lie because they dnt book us, THE FACILITY DOES. So because i spent 3 hours traveling from one end of ny to brooklyn to provide services to them they REFUSED TO PAY ME, told me and the aide that and is now not answering to shiftkey demands to pay me for the hour and a half i was there and trouble and travel pay because they wasted my time. Shiftkey, KNOWS ABOUT ALL OF THIS, and have been delaying my pay for 3 weeks now because of this and let this facility treat their workers anyway. My case was assigned to maribel and do you think she has reached back out to me? DONT WASTE YOUR TIME PEOPLE more Thank you for your review.

I think they should make it rule where facilities have to approve or deny a shift no later than 8 hours before it’s supposed to start. Tired of picking up five days in advance for a morning shift with no word or approval on if I’m working. Also tired of going to bed the night before and having to wake up early just to not have my shift approved. Also they need to add either the scheduler’s or the DON’s contact info. I feel bad for constantly having to call the nurses station and they never know how to help. The help option should be available 24/7. We work all hours of the day not just 9-5. Overall it’s just really annoying trying to navigate. I shouldn’t have to call facilities to have my shift approved they should be required to look at it as soon as they get it. I also don’t understand the premium shifts. I understood they pay more because they’re last minute help, but even those still take forever to be approved. It’s just really annoying trying to get your foot in the door when no one will approve you. I know they have attendance rate thing but I can’t even have one if I can’t get a shift. more Hello, Thank you for bringing this issue to our attention!

They have continually improved and updated since then and the updates have been helpful and the additional resources included in the app, such as messaging your actual, personal, local, medical providers and getting real-time responses in my experience on average 10 minutes or less. This is huge in helping veterans with social isolation or suicidal ideations and PTSD and other disabilities schedule appointments and reach out for care without physically talking to someone on the phone, but still being able to reach a VA employee who can schedule all the care needed on a case by case basis and tailor it to your personal needs. Since the amount of time a claim requires for processing from beginning to end is average 3-6 months they should consider upgrading to an even more in-depth system to show the veteran where they are in the process exactly without any assuming involved, the veterans next actions/steps to be done exactly, and a ballpark/estimated completion date would go a long way in improving the attitude of veterans towards the VA claims process. I believe it would eliminate some if not all of the uncertainty around the length of time the claim will be, and the feeling that the claim is not being handled or being given the attention it deserves, both would considerably reduce the amount of phone calls received daily pertaining to claims and status. 🇺🇸FYea more"

The only improvement I would like to see is an ability to refresh the status of a disability claim. For instance it is 4:30 in the afternoon now but it is showing my most recent status from when I checked it at 10pm yesterday. It seems you can only check it once per 24 hours with the app. This is fine most of the time but when they are getting close to publishing a final decision, I’d like to refresh more often.

I have Face ID setting turned on, yet every time I log in, there are probably six or seven screens to navigate through just to get in, including “waiting to redirect” and needing to text authentication codes every time. And when you log out, there are 4 pages and prompts to get through just to leave. The messaging system needs some work too. It only shows a portion of sent messages, and when you click the down arrow to expand the window, it still won’t show you the full message. And for writing new messages, the main message box is irritating at best. Accidentally touching outside of the box makes the text go gray, and the screen jump up and down. The cursor is like a sick joke being played on me, and most of the “continue” buttons need to be pressed at least two or three times to activate. I downloaded the app because it’s supposed to be simpler than using the website, but that doesn’t seem to be the reality. And considering that a lot of us veterans are suffering from PTSD and high anxiety, I would hope that the developers could create an app that doesn’t give me a near panic attack every time I need to use it.

Additionally, this could be added to the “…” above the chart for quicker customization. Add 8 hour option to Glucose trend graph. Plot blood glucose fingerpick readings on Glucose trend chart to be able to easily compare with CGM readings. Add “DarkMode” option for easier readability, especially at night. Add ability to describe or select from drop down menu the Activity; walk, run, swim, bicycle, treadmill, etc. Add ability to select from drop down menu the Meal type; breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack. Add ability to input Medication that isn’t in the search. Insulin Dose Log under Glucose tab should show up to 10 glucose readings instead of 3-4. Historical information under History tab should show more data without needing to download Clarity app. Additionally, filter options for blood glucose, insulin, medication, meal, activity, and note would be nice. Add a better way to report app bugs, provide feedback, etc. under Profile > Support > Feedback. Move Sensor information under Connections tab to Glucose tab and all the rest under Connections tab to Profile tab.

        "review": "This app is almost good. It’s missing two features that are standard in every other app in the AppStore. And with those features it would be 4 stars. 1. Most important. Be able to dismiss alerts from the Apple Watch. I get alert, dismiss the alert of the watch, but a minute later it alerts again. Making me have to open the app on my phone to dismiss the alert. If I’m in a meeting or somewhere important I can’t be pulling out my phone or having Loud critical alerts going off every couple of minutes for something I’ve taken care of. An even better feature would be to let me get a 1 minute quiet notification on my watch that I could clear before even setting off a critical alert. But as the way it is now, I’m going to have to turn off critical alert notifications, which is not a good thing. 2. This doesn’t seem like a big one, but it is. Dark mode. It exists on Dexcom Follow app, so I know there Devs know how to do it, and they should be using shared libraries, so why am I blinding my self at night to check my Blood Sugars? A device and technology so advanced it can tell me my blood sugar every 5 minutes just by looking at a screen, when just 20 years ago we were peeing on sticks, and not long before that peeing on the ground and watching for ants. But yet my retinas burn when I check my blood sugar. And my I get just as embarrassed as everyone stares at me thinking I didn’t mute my phone for the meeting. Please fix this. more Thank you.

        "review": "The app itself is works well for me and I like the features it does have. My issues with it are the features it lacks, starting with dark mode. Why, after all these years, is there no support for dark mode?! When I wake up in the middle of the night to deal with an alert it makes it that much harder to see, process, and understand what the app is trying to tell me when I'm being blinded by the glaring brightness of this solid white screen. I already set my screen brightness at its lowest level at night and it's still not enough. I don't have this issue with the Tandem t:connect app when I need to use my pump, because they actually implemented a dark mode. My next issue is with the watch app and how few watch faces the G7 complication even supports. I just updated my watch to watchOS 11 and the photo watch face, which I had previously been using the G7 complication with just fine, no longer shows the G7 as an option. Why????? Why does there seem to be so little support for developing this app? Why does it take so long to get anything updated in this app or to add any features? If the issue isn't Dexcom and instead it's healthcare regulations that are slowing everything down, why can't Dexcom be more transparent and open about it? more Thank you. We appreciate your review.

Message alerts don’t appear in the app, for many things the website had better information. “Your curriculum” (info and tips about whatever it is you’re using Ro for) is not in the app that I’ve found, however it’s on the main page on the website. Like others have mentioned, typing messages in the app is weird and doesn’t automatically give a space like typing in anything else with an iPhone. There’s no place in the app to go and review data you’ve entered (sort of goes along with my first point of no habit trackers). My overall experience outside of the app has been fine, but the app could definitely use some work. more Hi leo88p2, thanks for sharing this feedback.

But now I am on my 5th week and my insurance plan changed so I warned them multiple times via the chat, email AND the phone. Every single person I've talked to is on a completely different page. I finally ended up calling and the woman was like \"oh it looks like your insurance update was never properly communicated\"......after I sent it multiple times and told them multiple times.....now, they keep telling me \"they're looking for a different pharmacy with the medication in stock\" I keep telling them that I'm pretty sure they need to restart the authorization process since I got new insurance and NO ONE is listening. It's almost like I'm talking to a computer. Every single person I've talked to has said something completely different. I'm unsure when/if I'll ever get the medication again and now since they won't listen to me, it will be a lot farther out than I had anticipated and I'll have to start completely over on the dosage. Also, they claim they get back to you within 24-48 hours and shut off their phones so you can only email or chat and then they ignore you. I have NO idea when my issue will ever get resolved and honestly it's VERY frustrating. more Hi Merrr.H, I am really sorry to hear about the experience you've had on the Body Program, and I would love to help you resolve this issue. Please submit a request through the Mobile App that you need help with your account, address it to Alejandro (Sr Director, Member Experience), and say you're following up on your App Store review.

        "review": "I was so excited when I found out about Ro and the weight loss program they have. They made it easy to get PAs and get my initial medication arranged. It all pretty much went down hill from there. The app is suuuuper clunky. It asks you to log doses and do checkins on your Home Screen only to give you errors that it’s “too early” since your last shot to do them- well then don’t prompt me to. It also doesn’t let you change any of the information you’ve entered, so for one of my weight logs I hit an 8 instead of a 7 for a number and wouldn’t let me change it, so it looks like I randomly gained 10 lbs one week. They are SLOW to respond to messages and when they do they are so clearly a canned message response it’s infuriating. It misses half of what you asked about or includes multiple things you didn’t ask about at all. For $145/month, not including the medication, I expect a lot better. Would recommend Zepbound in a heartbeat, but safe yourself some frustration and get it somewhere else. more Hi there- I'm so sorry to hear this was your experience with us.

        "review": "I only use the Owlet Dream Sock and although I am pleased with the sock itself and it’s designed purpose of helping keep my mind at ease while my baby sleeps, I am not impressed with the app itself. It takes several “refreshes” and even closing and re-opening the app in order to see the current sleep state. I wish the app would provide some sort of chart that shows awake, light and deep sleep patterns. My Apple Watch tells me more about my sleep patterns than the Owlet does for my baby. Lastly there should be some sort of turn off or check-in button when it’s having “difficulty getting readings”. There will be times where I’m holding my baby, I know he’s fine and even though I dismiss the notification the base will still continue to sound and it’s frustrating. Also I had to move the base to his actual changing table because otherwise when I take it off the base as I’m getting him ready for bed the sock will start alarming if I don’t put it on asap. I’ll snooze the base and it will literally go off in what feels like another minute. There could maybe be some sort of, ready to start tracking sleep button. Overall, the sock does it’s job of keeping track of my baby’s heart rate, oxygen level and sleep status but doesn’t do much more than that. You’d think for $300 the app would be better. more"

        "review": "This app needs serious improvement. It claims to “clinacally proven, medical grade accuracy” which is true, as long as you can get the app to stay open long enough to load the levels. The app is constantly quitting while in the middle of “loading” my babies vitals and sleep state. It takes 10 or so minutes to update the current sleep state. And often times, I click on my babies profile to see the sleep state and it shows there is no sock connected, causing me to reset everything at 1:00, 2:00, 3:00 in the morning. The range from sock to base is not designed for bigger houses. When we bring our babies from their room to the living room, the base will beep at you constantly because of connectivity issues. And our living room is the same distance as their room. Even if you turn the base off completly, it seems to still beep after a few minutes of getting readings. And when it is beeping at you, trying to open the app takes even longer so I’m sitting there overstimulated with a screaming baby and a phone & base that won’t stop beeping because the app takes FOREVER to load. I love that this is designed to alert me and to keep my baby safe and I will say it has helped me get better sleep since my twins were born. But we spent almost $700 on these two owlet socks. For that money, this app should be working way better than what it is. Do better, Owlet. Do way way better. more Hello from the Engineering team at Owlet.

I will say the sock is a great idea giving your baby's heart rate and oxygen level, however, it causes more anxiety when not working and how poorly supported it is by the app. The way it works in regards to the charging station, the location of where it needs to be, and troubleshooting any connection issue is the most annoying and inconvenient. The sock needs to be in the charging station when not in use or else you set off the alerts, and that is also where the alerts noise comes in as well as the app, so you can't have it near a sleeping baby and there is no off button on it (there is snooze) or else levels are not monitored and the app reflects as base station off, in other words not reading levels. We have it outside of the nursery and have to run back and forth when putting it on baby. Just another step in our bed/nap time routine at this point. I continue to use it because when it works it's awesome and I love to see how his hr/O2 fluctuates between sleep cycles, just frustrated with the poor connectivity to the app and the troubleshooting anxiety that one has to go through to get back online/refreshing app especially at 3 am when you are already sleep deprived. more"

    "appDescription": "Recommendations on Mechanical Ventilation parameters. Non-invasive estimation of PaO2/FiO2, severity of Acute Respiratory Failure (SOFA score). Caution! This app is intended for intensive care physicians. If you are NOT a physician and would like to use it anyway, please consult your physician before using this app or making any medical decisions. This app has endorsement for usage in the Russian Federation. Many doctors deal with the treatment of patients with varying degrees of acute respiratory failure (ARF). But the choice of the optimal method and, especially, the timely correction of the parameters of invasive and non-invasive mechanical lung ventilation often cause difficulties, especially for young doctors. Unfortunately, expensive ventilation machines, without their skillful use, are not a guarantee of an improvement in the mortality rate in ARF. This has been especially evident during the COVID-19 pandemic. In international clinical practice, it is customary to determine the degree of ARF by the oxygenation index (the ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2)). This indicator is also included in most \"severity of illness\" scoring systems (SOFA, APACHE II-III, etc.). However PaO2 estimation is only possible after collecting the arterial blood for laboratory monitoring of blood gases, making it costly and invasive. In 2020-2021 a multicenter research was carried out at five clinical hospitals in Volgograd, Russia, which included 1038 patients with acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome against the background of viral (COVID-19) and bacterial pneumonia. The goals of the research were firstly, to develop a non-invasive method for determining the oxygenation index (PaO2 / FiO2) based on oxygen saturation (SpO2), and secondly, to define general criteria for correcting the parameters of invasive and non-invasive mechanical ventilation. This application is based on the results of the research. The relationship between SpO2 and PaO2 index values was determined for various FiO2 and types of respiratory support. The app also implements the general principle of oxygen therapy - from less to more invasive. The app allows the user not only to choose the most effective method of respiratory support, but also timely learn about the need for its correction. Every clinician knows that the mortality rate in patients with ARF is greatly influenced by the validity of the beginning and end of Invasive Mechanical Ventilation treatment - and this app solves this problem. The educational effect of this app should also be noted. It will help doctors to quickly master and more competently use expensive ventilation machines, which, of course, will have a beneficial effect on the results of treatment of patients with ARF.

        "review": "Honestly I’m so so happy I found out about this app. I was researching pet insurances that will cover preexisting conditions and it basically doesn’t exist. Pawp does!!! They have an emergency fund that will cover a good chunk of the vet bill for my special needs dog if he needs to be hospitalized again. Each hospitalization costs around $5,000 and he’s already had 4. We were stressing about how we could possibly do it again if he needs it but Pawp has come to the rescue. We have our emergency fund if we ever need it! ALSO the 24/7 vet care is amazing. I’ve used it a few times. I had to use it today. Two of my five dogs got into a scuffle and one came out of it with a gash on her head. I sent a picture to a veterinarian in Pawp and they helped me come up with a home treatment plan and saved me tons of money and stress by not having to go to emergency for a tiny little head wound. They gave me peace of mind and a plan of action and I feel confident that everything is going to be okay. Every time I’ve needed help they’ve been there and provided great assistance. I HIGHLY recommend this service. Especially if you’re like me and use all 6 of those slots. My dogs get wild and I’m so glad to have vet care at my hands without spending hundreds to have an in office assessment unless it’s really needed. This app is a game changer and I’m so so so glad we have it. more Thank you for taking the time to leave a review. We appreciate your kind words!

        "review": "TLDR: Worry warts: if you’re on the fence, get the app. This app will save your heart from so much worry and give you your peace of mind back!! This app is worth the annual fee in just one care visit—and I felt that way even before having my first one-on-one chat with the doctor. If you’ve ever been up all night with a sick pup who can’t tell you what’s wrong—especially if you don’t have a lot of extra income—you probably know how it feels to be in the anxiety spiral of “is this an emergency or not??” You don’t want to pay the cost of ER if it’s just your own dramatics (my dog can look at me wrong and I’ll get worried he’s sick), you are not interested in an appointment for 2 weeks later at a regular vet (“what if they’re dead by then?!?!! Isn’t there anything tomorrow!!?”) , and the internet doesn’t ease any anxiety. Pawp just eliminated all of those stresses for me. Just the click through question and answer process made me feel better and empowered me with information. I talked to Dr. Ana afterwards just for more clarification and she gave me detailed instructions on how to help and monitor my pup. And the emergency fund buy-in also is incredible peace of mind for us worry warts. I’d rate this higher if I could. Thank you Pawp!!!!!!!!! more"

I use it all the time for questions I have that I don’t want to go to the vet and spend $100 per visit or when I have a serious issue with my dog that I need immediate help and not sure what to do! It’s like having a vet live with you 24/7! You get to send them pictures of the issue, and have a licensed vet explain what is happening and what to do next! Their vet is able to tell you what over the counter medication to get or do to help your fur baby & provides exact instructions and recommendations! I feel like I’ve been given even better advice and personalized care than most vets I’ve been to. You get to track your past visits and history within the app. You can have multiple dogs/cats for the same price which is amazing! I’m on my second year, I renewed my subscription when I saw how much I used it the first year & did not want to be without this!! The vets have all been so friendly & helpful! I promise, this is the easiest and fastest way to get help for your fur babies!! Don’t be caught off guard in a bad situation and wish you had access to help!

With the last one I could actually find my hearing aids and now it just gives me a general vicinity and sometimes it doesn’t say that it has connected to it at all, why can’t something be added to Oticon that would play a loud sound like a Tile does so that you could find your hearing aids.

The new app Oticon Companion was released to keep up with the technical requirements from Google and Apple and make sure that our app stays compatible with new Android and iOS phone operating system. Oticon Companion will be receiving new features and updates and we strive to make it as user friendly and stable as possible in future app updates. If you are experiencing connectivity issues with the new app, please check if you still have the old app on your phone, as it might be interfering with Oticon Companion's connectivity.

        "review": "Oticon Companion is a TERRIBLE APP. I loved having Oticon On; it was wonderful. Things stayed connected. Never had any issues launching the app or communicating between my Apple Watch and my iPhone and the hearing aids. Was forced to changed to Oticon Companion by the manufacturer. It has sucked ever since. My hearing aids will randomly stop being paired for no apparent reason. The app loads slowly, it takes for every to re-pair. Sometimes the watch won't change the HA settings when I ask it to. I rely on these hearing aids to be able to function in my everyday environment. It got so bad, that a month ago, I actually had my audiologist send my hearing aids in one at time to the manufacturer for repair because it was disconnecting so frequently, I assumed it was a mechanical failure of the HAs themselves. Oticon couldn't find anything wrong, so they ended up replacing both hearing aids (thankfully, it was on their dime- they were ONLY a year old!!) They're disconnecting less frequently now, but they're still disconnecting. And it's FRUSTRATING. Based on this, I can only assume that it's an app issue and, when it comes time to get new hearing aids, I will be looking at other products where the technology integration is more SEAMLESS and BETTER SUPPORTED. VERY DISAPPOINTED. more Hi, thank you for your feedback. I am very sorry to hear that you are having these in-app disconnections. We will be happy to do all we can to help get you a stable connection. Please write us at appsupport@oticon.com and we will be happy to do all we can to troubleshoot this so that you can have a stable connection between your hearing aids and iPhone. A common cause for in-app disconnections can be if the hearing aids are connected to another device, such as an iPad. If this is the case, the way to transfer the connection between devices running iOS 17 is to change the audio input by tapping the airplay symbol in the top right part of the control center (opened by swiping down from the top right corner of your device) and choosing your hearing aids. For devices running iOS 16 or older you can transfer the in-app connection by starting to play any sound from the device you want to use with your hearing aids. Alternatively, it can be necessary in some cases to toggle Bluetooth OFF on the iOS device not used with the hearing aids. Best regards, Oticon more"

My Previous hearing aids were less than $1000 Resound hearing aids that were very reliable and easily accessible Simple pairing with the iPhone : Take them from the substantial closed charger. Put them in my ears and turn on the phone! These $6,000 Oticons have no relationship, consistent pairing nor clear guidance for operation. The Resound User interface was graphic and animated. These Oticon aids and charger are unwieldy and frequently just turn off after wearing for an hour or two. I’ve had them for 2or3 months, with a lot of visits to the office. The performance is deteriorating and every visit cost (even if my dog HAD NOT eaten them and caused them to require replacement ) I then paid TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS for a heavier charger that closed so that it could sit on my nightstand and not exposed, inviting the puppy to take the devices, being far more interesting than her many objects DESIGNED and abundantly available for chewing. I was originally going to get Resound devices. If I can return these Oticons more Dear user, we would like to investigate in the root cause for the connectivity issues that you are experiencing.

The “support” they offer is a call center rep telling you that the results are positive and go to the doctor. I didn’t ask for a definitive diagnosis, but selling this as offering support is deceptive marketing, if not outright lying. You can talk to a “provider” but it is just a mid-level who cannot diagnose. I can read “positive” and “talk to a doctor” without a call center rep or paying a midlevel to read it to me. What is the point of a test not providing numbers and ranges?! Are they just randomly throwing out positives and negatives in results?! Further, my doctor (actual DO who uses a reputable lab) repeated the testing and my results were NOT positive, not even close to positive. In fact, not only was I NOT positive on the one thing they said I was, I WAS positive on the thing they said I was not! Total joke and waste of money. Very deceptive marketing. Other reputable labs will do many of these same tests for cash pay and actually provide numbers and resources to understand numbers. What a joke. more Hi!

        "review": "I have a 6 month old that never slept in any of the months of her life, when she hit the four months “regression,” I was already so sleep deprived it felt no different. I was angry, frustrated and at the end of my rope. My husband and I work 24-hour shifts, I’m also a full-time paramedic student and finishing degrees, so operating on no sleep and then trying to make it through the day, just to come home again and not sleep was so defeating. Our baby was up every hour, and wouldn’t go down until almost 3-4am EVERY night. Around 4 months old, I found this app and for the first time she started to slept through the night or at least in 4-5 hour stretches. When I tell you I had tried EVERYTHING, I had tried everything. Routines, sleeping time lotions, natural remedies, different bed times etc, this was the only thing that actually worked for us. I figured we had it down now and I could delete the app, WRONG lol… we slowly regressed back to original state. I redownloaded the app 2 days ago, and last night she slept from 12a-7a. Tonight she’s been asleep from from 8:30p-now, with ZERO wake-up’s. I thank this app for reinstating my sanity and making me such a happier mom. If you’re like me and just not sure how to proceed, PLEASE give this app a try. more"

        "review": "I am not and have never been a good sleeper. I know I want my son to have a fighting chance but what we were doing prior to this app was a little chaotic. This app gives me a template of how my day may go and helps me plan better and make a routine for my almost 8 month old. Before it I was very overwhelmed. It’s been only a week and I have seen such an improvement in the way he falls and stays asleep. I used to laugh at the “drowsy but awake” mantra and now I’m living it. There is so much more consistency in his sleep. We are working on staying asleep past 5am, but the improvements I’ve seen have given me the confidence in both myself and my son to push through and stay consistent as well and start to work on nap time and conquering these contact naps. This app may not work for everyone immediately but I think it’s worth a try. The price is fair to me and I’m surprised a lot of people said it was too high. This is more than a sleep tracking app despite what other reviews say. There’s a little more help involved and the positive messages, tips, and lessons help me so much. At least take advantage of the free trial! Good luck, parents! more Thank you so much for taking the time to leave us this awesome review! We work so hard to help parents get more sleep and reviews like this make it all worthwhile! Wishing you lots more sleep in the future! ~Mandy, Pediatric Sleep Consultant more"

        "review": "I wanted to like this app so much but since using it I've come across many issues. After completing several of the courses I find out I can't access my baby's sleep plan until he's 12 weeks old (he's only 6 weeks). So now I've paid for a 3 month subscription and can only use it for its intended use for a portion of that time. The other really annoying issue is the internal timer when recording a nursing session. On many occasions in there middle of using the timer, I've exited the app only to come back and see that the timer has reset itself back to zero so I have no idea how long I've been nursing for. Tonight when doing a night feeding the timer wouldn't even start at all so I had to manually input the feeding session. What's the point of this timer function if it doesn't even work properly half the time?!?! I gave this app one star because I like that I can track my baby's naps and wake windows which I find very helpful however the smart AI tool has issues as well when adjusting his schedule. I track all of his naps including any wake ups he has during the naps. The AI continues to suggest a 5th nap every day around 5pm which my baby refuses no matter how many times I try and doesn't readjust the schedule!! So dumb and definitely not worth a paid subscription for how expensive this app is. Also most of the information in the courses is stuff I already knew just from reading on google which is free. Waste of money. more"

        "review": "If you’re already familiar with the drug they’re prescribing then this service is great. I moved away from my hometown and my psychiatrist couldn’t prescribe my meds if I lived in a different state than where she is licensed. So it was very convenient for me to hop on HERS and get a prescription very quickly without all the bells and whistles as when I went the traditional route, it took almost 2 months for my doctor to diagnose me and write a prescription. With that being said, after 2 months, I was very informed about the drug I was being prescribed and was confident that it would work because my doctor took the time to get to know me and listen to what I needed. So I’m not sure how this App can just issue psychiatric medication to ppl who’ve never been assessed by a professional in depth and may have no experience with these types of drugs. In a nutshell, it was great for me because I know what I’m getting into and pretty much just needed a refill but to someone who’s completely new to medication, it runs the risk of being a little sketchy. more Hey, We appreciate you sharing your experience and providing us with feedback!

        "review": "After inputting all the needed information to receive help for hair loss, I was directed to a page where I had to input my credit card information. While I expected their services to be a paying service I thought they would have the opportunity for people to receive services through their health insurance. This wasn’t an option so I had to decline the service in general. Not everyone can afford $35 - $175 a month. I guess I had this assumption because I was a proud customer of online birth control for years and I received those services with my health insurance and NOT with monthly payments on a credit card or Apple Pay account. By not having an option for people to pay with health care insurance it excludes many people who need help health wise yet can’t obtain it due to their finances. It’s an endless cycle where only the “well off” can afford decent health care services (medicine, counseling, therapy, etc.) Thank you for reading. I will recommend this service to others because I can recognize the amazing potential within it but people should know ahead of time that Hers/Hims do not accept health insurance. more We appreciate you sharing your experience and providing us with feedback!

        "review": "**DO NOT USE THIS APP IF YOU HAVE AN EATING DISORDER.** I’ve been using Hers for a year or so for Anxiety meds at first, and then Birth Control. I agree with every single review about only using this app if you already are prescribed the medication and are looking for an easy refill option or a cheaper alternative. About a month ago or so, they started pushing notifications, pop ups, recommendations etc for GLP-1 injections. Not only does this seem very odd, since injections don’t really seem like a “just for anyone” type of solution, but on a personal note, in both of my provider questionnaires I filled out, I was very transparent about my ongoing struggles with an eating disorder. At this point, to be pushed Ozempic, is SO inconsiderate and dangerous for those that aren’t doing well in their own recovery journeys. Not only should Ozempic quit being pushed for weight loss, but to blindly push this towards a client base that overwhelmingly struggles with many kinds of disorders comes off as incredibly predatory. To have the kind of money this business has, and not be able to turn off or hide “weight loss drugs” from their clients seems like a massive oversight. If they care AT ALL about the people they’re providing care towards, they will remove these annoying notifications and DO BETTER in actually taking care of people. Gross. more"

I scanned like 10 things then it said I have to pay, I don’t know about y'all, but I was really looking forward to finally finding a free beauty scanning app. I was so tired of looking it up on google and not finding anything so I downloaded this. I only rated it 5 stars so everyone can see this. I would have rated it three. Like I was saying, it is a great app but I had to delete it because I didn’t really want to pay to keep my skin safe. I have really bad acne and loved the quizzes and stuff to find out what helps me but I hate that I have to pay to do it. I overall love this app and would download it again if it was like 100% free. This was probably the best one I have tried but again, IS NOT FREE! Wish I could actually find one that is free or if this one was free I would love it more than I already do, I hope On Skin reads this comment and if you do On Skin please please please comment on it.

I’ve tested this on my very tiny skincare collection (if you can even call it that?) which consists of a moisturizer and a really good face wash, and it told me multiple good things and 1-2 bad things. I ended up doing some research on these ingredients, and most of it happened to be true. But then I deleted it because I didn’t need it anymore… Until I met a really good hair care friend who used a similar looking app. Then I thought to write this review. (Ah yes, my ADHD brain…) And I read a review or two, but there were multiple I didn’t read except the first couple sentences. 2/3 of them said that it gave them different answers each time they scanned and told them their products (which they described as amazing) were making their skin dry. So now I am questioning… Anyways, this really helped me, but I have a feeling that since everyone’s skin type is different, everyone’s skin reacted different to it, making the app ‘untrustworthy’. So, in conclusion, this app is fine, but because it doesn’t review your skin in person (or even a simple questionnaire), it’s not as accurate as a real dermatologist. more"

Also it can still be a good match for your skin type regardless. I feel like a lot of the negative reviews don’t understand that part. For example- The cetaphil healthy radiance serum is a 49% safety but a good match for my skin. i use this product often and i love it, but reading the ingredient definitions just made me aware of any risks. I haven’t had issues with the serum- but that doesn’t mean it won’t harm someone else’s skin. I imagine this helps with finding out what ingredients someone is more sensitive/ allergic to. Also, there is a free version! i have used plenty of scans with no bumps in the road so far. more"

        "review": "This app effectively shows me gibberish, with ‘explanations’ that simply repeat the gibberish. Worthless app; leaves my uninformed after wasting my time to sign up, get in, and peruse the available text. This simply reflects related worthless paper invoices. Bad info is bad info - whether you make it available digitally or hard copy. When billing a patient, the descriptions should be written in a way a non-medical human (e.g., the people you are demanding payment from) can recognize what medical service they need to pay for, so they can agree with confidence that they did receive that service and so are ok paying for it. My invoices are effectively gibberish. And when a patient - me - is confronted with literally dozens of documents from multiple providers for one single health event and being asked to pay thousands of dollars cumulatively across them, it should be unacceptable to all billers that I can’t understand what I’m being asked to pay for. I’d rate this a zero if I could. I came here hoping for help to understand the vast wad of medical invoices I have on my desk and it completely wasted my time. Plus I can’t pay here - would make much more sense to show an understandable invoice with a button giving me the immediate opportunity to pay it. more We are so sorry you have had such a difficult time and truly appreciate you writing us a review.

I’ve used it since NP school and haven’t found anything else that I like better. I’ve worked in the primary care/urgent care setting. The only thing that I would want that Epocrates doesn’t offer (I don’t believe) is A little more info on IV drugs for instance “this should be a slow push over 2 minutes”... obviously we don’t do that in an outpatient setting but when I worked in the hospital those extra tips would have been helpful- I would feel like Epocrates truly had it all of they added that! more"

Simple stuff. I type in Pataday. The mobile app shows \"Pataday\". I click on it just to be fed to a blank page that says \"now OTC\"!? Great, where's the other information. So I search generic name where it has so truncated the information that you can't really use it as needed. For example, it lists generic name then both strengths of olopatidine but doesn't differentiate which correlates to the brand, and in this case, drug strength you're looking for. It may sound trivial but this happens often using their mobile site. And don't get me started on finding pK info and any meaningful pregnancy and lactation information on the web app. I really think that for paying users you should create a web version of the online Epocrates platform. I found that very useful in pharmacy school, on rotations, etc. I need that as a mobile friendly version! more Thank you for your feedback! We're very sorry for the trouble you've experienced!

You are supposed to be able to search for what you need to know from this obligatory News screen. And that would be fine. If it worked. But 9/10 it doesn’t, you can’t, and the app crashes/stalls. I’ve emailed twice about this through the app and received personalized replies, but I could tell they were meaningless…and the issue still hasn’t been resolved.

I am expecting a baby girl and I am 5 months along. I have used this app since the beginning of my pregnancy and since then have tried a few other apps just making sure i’m using the one I enjoy the most. What to Expect has lots of awesome features hence why I love it. It has an option to show you how much your belly will grow along with your baby size week by week. If i have any upcoming events happening I love to see what to expect when the date comes along! I also really enjoy the fact there are multiple short videos every week for you to watch about what your baby will be developing in the womb week by week. Something else I really like about this app is it has a community area where you can join groups that fit you and you can ask whatever questions you would like or you can read over already asked questions or give advice of your own. It’s a great place for you to feel better when weird side effects come along.

Sometimes during pregnancy, you definitely can feel alone, & I feel like the community tab definitely helps those feelings subside when you see just how many other women are going through exactly what you are. Especially when you join a topic for your due date month! I’ve met so many different girls who are due either on the same day, or same week as I am & it makes me happy to know that I’m not the only one experiencing this or that.

The reporting aspect of the app is poorly done, and that’s the most important part. In the free version, the ads after a day become so obnoxious that it’s fundamentally unusable. Full screen ads with the volume forced to 100% that offends everyone in the room. If you purchase this app you are funding a company that cares about monetizing the app far more than providing a good user experience. A premium subscription is VERY expensive, and honestly provides only a few real benefits, outside of removing the ads. I will look at EVERY alternative in the App Store before I feed this marketing tactic. There is a “plus” version with a one time app purchase that likely removes some ads, but there is no clear statement of any difference so the only way to know is to buy it and find out. If you read enough review responses, you will learn if you buy that version you simply get another nagging form of encouragement to buy the expensive subscription. What this app provides is worth no where close to what the premium version provides. more"

With just a few taps, users have access to all the necessary data to care for a pediatric patient in the emergent setting, including weight-based and age specific medication dosages and equipment sizes. Since many of the patients present with minimal known information, all the results can be calculated rapidly with only a known age, date-of-birth, weight, length, or height. Simply enter the known variable and the data is instantly calculated. Developed by an Emergency Physician, this app minimizes the risk of medical errors allowing the provider to spend more time caring for the patient, and less time looking up and calculating doses. It is a critical companion for any physician, nurse, paramedic, or medical trainee involved in the care of critically ill pediatric patients. more",

Recently any action generates numerous error popups indicating a connection or network problem. I deleted the app and reinstalled the latest version from the App Store but now even trying to login generates a connection or server error. Fortunately I am able to access the UTD web site, but there have been several circumstances where I have been in areas without WiFi or cell service under emergency conditions and unable to access the offline content due to need to update the offline content. Certainly if one cannot login or access information, especially under urgent medical situations, the app is not useful so I can’t justify more than one star if the app doesn’t work. My advice to many others out there who also have this problem is don’t buy individual subscriptions and just use institutional accounts when connected to a work machine and look to other reliable apps that offer offline content when in need of urgent medical information ( and there are many). Our practice and affiliated hospitals no longer use UTD because of unreliable access issues. The quality of medical care in the USA has deteriorated due to problems with technology and this is another example of a chronic technology problem afflicting many that UTD does not appear capable of repairing.

I use the app multiple times a day and use it to assist with diagnosis, differentials, quick treatment guide, and most importantly as an education tool for the patient. I often will pull up a known diagnosis and show the patient similar photos to their condition from the expansive photo bank to help support a diagnosis. Furthermore, i frequently print out patient handouts for patients so that they have a reliable and physician-vetted document to help answer any questions that remain after our patient encounter. All in all, this is the single best and most used app I use in clinical practice as a dermatologist. Very useful for med students to experienced physicians and I highly recommend. more"

Also, the app does not provide anything more than stagnant vitals (like a single not even complete set obtained during some point of the hospitalization). A tab for vitals (that can be customized [because maybe all I care about are MAPs, etc]) similar to the tab for lab results would go a long way in making this app much more functional for those of us tracking pts over the course of the day and making pt care decisions.

My rounding starts with it, and most of my work is done from Haiku, reviewing recent vitals, labs, putting orders, adjusting meds, etc.. I also start my notes using the in-app dictation feature right after I see a patient and even do my billing from Haiku but unfortunately I cannot finish my notes in Haiku because of the lack of smart links that are routinely used in notes (meds, vitals, labs, I/O) to be able to properly bill. Without smart links in Haiku one have to go to the desktop at the end of the day to finish notes. To improve rounding efficiency smart links have to be added to haiku note writing. ALL providers use their phone haiku apps to round, I have rarely seen any use canto on iPad and thus more improvements and development should be done on Haiku. Update: still one year later smart links for writing notes are not available on Haiku. The goal is to be able for some providers to be able t do all their inpatient rounding work in Haiku from start to finish. Also would help to hav the ability to build notes in Haiku that can be copied forward and easily edited where necessary and the smart links are automatically updated.

        "review": "Absolutely wonderful having this app! I love that I can chose ANY doctor that I want, just based off of their availability. There is absolutely nothing worse than having to Google “doctors near me” and having to call each individual one to find out who can or has time to see you immediately! Oh, and if you don’t make an appointment with each one at the very moment, by the time you call back bc you wasted all that time calling every single doctor, just to realize that one was the soonest appointment and doctor available even though they are booked 3 weeks out at the moment, then by the time you call back to schedule that appointment, it’s already been taken!!! So now you have to wait 4 weeks to be seen! So, basically, like I’ve said, this is an absolutely great app for SO many reason other than just what I’ve mentioned. I recommend this app to everyone I know for it’s easy convenience! Also nice that I don’t have to deal with calling and as soon as someone answers the phone, I’m not being thrown on hold before I’m even given the chance to answer them back as to if, “it’s okay to hold!” So take it from me, this is a MUST HAVE app!!! more"

        "review": "For starters, the site is not as easy to navigate as they make it look on TV. Secondly, they just give you a list of all providers for the particular issue you’re looking for without telling you whether or not they’re in your insurance plan so you have to go through each doctors profile one at a time to see if they’re in network for your insurance. Then once I finally found a doctor and booked an appointment, THEN they informed me that the doctor has to be in the same state as you regardless of the fact that it’s a video visit. So why was the list showing me doctors for all 50 states in the country when I had already put in my address?!!!! So I had to cancel the appointment with that doctor and then find a doctor that was both in my insurance and in the state of Connecticut from this big long list of providers from all insurance plans all over the country I finally found a doctor and booked an appointment. A few hours before the appointment, his billing department calls me looking for “more information”, but my phone showed that their phone number is located out of Texas!! What kind of doctor operates in Connecticut and has a billing department in Texas?! At this point, I was beginning to doubt the safety of this site when it comes to my personal information and I already gave them copies of my insurance card!!!!! I am seriously concerned now about being a victim of identity theft, and having someone else get medical treatment using my insurance card. more"

        "review": "Zocdoc has changed dramatically. The service used to charge doctors a flat fee to be on provider list. Patients who needed to see a doctor could always find someone and pay a reasonable fee if no insurance and expect to use most insurances including Medi-Cal and HMO. If they wanted to schedule with same doctor for follow up, this option was always available. Since June of 2022, the billing structure has changed. The doctor has to pay $40 for each patient who books online, whether the patient is seen or not. This, of course, became a much more expensive proposition for the doctor and he has option to cap his monthly expense, which makes him unavailable to receive any future referrals after he reaches the cap. The new billing structure placed a huge barrier to patient-doctor interaction on Zocdoc. Firstly, the doctor can’t afford to accept Medi-Cal or HMO patients anymore. Secondly, to cover increased expenses, the doctor must increase his charges for patients coming from zocdoc. Thirdly, the moment the doctor reaches his cap he becomes unavailable to more patients on zocdoc. Therefore, the choice of doctors, obviously, diminishes drastically. My advice, find a different service to look for doctors, just do a simple Google search. Zocdoc isn’t worth it. Developer responded with a lame robotic answer, not covering a single issue raised by my review, just call us if you have questions…yeah right. more Thanks so much for providing us with your feedback. Zocdoc is a paid marketing platform for providers, and our pricing was determined by a valuation study conducted by a reputable third party for the types of services Zocdoc is providing to them. Providers also have multiple options to ensure that their information and availability are correct, as well as ways to make this platform as beneficial as possible for them. However, Zocdoc remains a free booking service for our patients! Please give us a call at (855) 962-3621 if you'd like to discuss this any further. more"

        "review": "In general, the One Medical app is a great way to quickly communicate with my medical provider. But there are two super frustrating bugs I hope the team could fix. One, the app frequently deletes draft messages when you switch to another app. If you’re writing a message with long prescription names answering detailed questions from your medical provider, then lose everything, it’s brutal. Secondly, the app disabled basic copy and paste when you’re writing messages. So don’t bother trying to compose messages in another app to avoid losing your data. You won’t be able to share that information with your medical provider. Please fix these minor bugs, One Medical team, and your otherwise great app will be wonderful for your patients. Thanks! more"

Then with the second child three years later, it continues to be unresolved and we have to use a THIRD email address, logging in and out. Add my partners membership and this one App has us logging in and out with FOUR different email addresses in order to access a significant aspect of what we are paying One Medical to be a part of: convenience. Making and changing appointments, video visits , lab results, messaging care providers etc. Permissions and multiple accounts under one login has been solved. It is wild to me as someone who works in Tech that this is still the experience for One Medical. If My Chart and our local hospital systems can figure this out, why is One Medical not making similar changes. HIPPA already addressed child/parent privacy concerns so that cannot be the issue.

        "review": "I’ve noticed that the Care Plan tab currently shows every action item, even when some of them are multi-step tasks. For example, I have three referrals to schedule, but the only option to ‘mark it done’ is after I’ve completed the visit, not when I’ve scheduled the appointment. This leads to pending tasks lingering for months, especially for labs that are scheduled months ahead, which makes the task list feel overwhelming. It would be very helpful if I could mark tasks as ‘scheduled,’ and input the date of the appointment. This way, the badge number on the Care Plan tab could decrease based on how many appointments are scheduled. For labs or other items that can’t be rushed (e.g., a lab due in three months), the same process would work well. This feature would allow me to keep track of upcoming tasks more easily and ensure the Care Plan reflects real-time progress. Thank you for considering this improvement! more"

I am still really happy with it. <Disclaimer: I was invited to participate in the IPO and bought some stock. That has appreciated nicely.> ——————- I am very much a fan of Doximity. I was originally mildly interested in it for connecting with old classmates, and somewhat interested in the news. But now, particularly since I’m practicing from home and exclusively online, I use it daily. I understand it is HIPAA-compliant: 1) I use Dialer to call patients. I use my own cell phone, but Dialer disguises my phone number, using my office number as the Caller ID. 2) I use another service sometimes, but many of my patient visits are using Dialer. I can place only an audio call, or can send a link to my patient’s cell phone. They click on it and we have a video call. The quality of the connection is overall good, of course often limited by the cell signal my patient is experiencing. 3) I can send and receive faxes. Just yesterday, I had to complete an FMLA form. I scanned it, saved the images, and securely faxed the images. It was quick and easy. And this is FREE!! I imagine Doximity is using and selling my data somehow, but I really have no complaint. more"

I now work for the State, which can entail being at up to 5 different locations in the course of a work week. \"Retirement\" from practice should not have to mean feeling that you've lost the \"privileges\" of being part of so noble a profession. And, let's face it, after nearly 35 years of getting the VIP treatment, it's hard to let go of that. Doximity's e-fax capability helps you maintain that status and professional independence. It's nice to have your office (\"private practice\") in your pocket. Recently I had to see three specialists and it involved a lot of imaging and labwork. To have virtually immediate access upon request or getting CC'd to your private, secure and virtual \"office\" is truly a luxury. While e-faxing has existed for years, using it in the Doximity context / community also helps keep me linked professionally. With regard to the quality of the articles and subject matter, I can definitely use an easy read from time to time. Grateful for the excellent job you're doing! more"

I don’t want to have to do this but if I am going to invest the time, I want to have useful data. This ap allows a lot of individualization, both of data type as well as granularity. It is taking a little longer to figure out how to optimally use than a less customizable ap but I greatly appreciate having this flexibility. So, e.g., if I want to list only 2 items for a day, such as “coffee” and “heartburn” I could do that. Or if I want to list detailed ingredients and quantities and exact times with free text comments in multiple categories, I can also do that. If over time I realize I need to go more or less granular or add or subtract a category, I can do that. After using for a few days, the selectable entries became much quicker as the ap defaults to listing prior entries as available selections for subsequent days. If you are like me, you are taking some of the same meds and supplements and eating many of the same foods each day. I don’t have enough data yet for extensive analysis yet but look forward to exploring these features more as well. There is a wealth of information available here, so far it has been well worth the time I have invested. more"

The functionality is amazing— so much more than you’d expect for an inexpensive little app. The ability to toggle on/off certain configurations / ways the algorithm works / analysis period to find top suspects— is evidence of the care and pride into this app. I could not believe when I went on vacation, the times of each entry changed for that day, so I didn’t have to do any more work (ie, pretending to be on a different timezone that day) so my “X hours after” ingestion values weren’t wrecked— it just worked, without any human adjustment needed! Clearly someone has thought long and hard about every scenario, and taken steps to address it in the app. I think the ability to either create a new recipe or replace all previous instances of the recipe with your new entry is essential, and without it, I doubt the results would ever be accurate. Basically I’m blown away by this app!!!! I should note that I find technology intuitive in general. If you want a more beginner’s app, and you’re willing to trade functionality for ease of learning the app, maybe you’d want to choose a different one. Personally I’m so glad I didn’t. This app rocks!!! more Thanks for your review - it's great to hear you think mySymptoms rocks! :-) If there's anything we can improve, general feedback, or questions, please drop us an email by going to More > Suggest an improvement.

        "review": "I have been struggling with epilepsy and a bipolar disorder my entire ie due to a dr mishandling forceps when I was a born and no one believes that smoking weed for 37 years has helped. Now this is a new century and things need to change because weed keeps my head in line and it’s way over priced for being a plant. Never once have I gotten sick or have of because of marijuana and now with it becoming legal I need exotic strains because pills kill hand herb heals and social security income isn’t enough money for something that helps me such a great deal and with it being a plant the prices are refocus in Chicago and I’m going to the drs office to have my dr fill out the information I need to help me get my card because, I don’t understand how to do it on my own. I started smoking weed at the age of 6 and I’ll be 44 in April. It’s been a long time to wait for legalization, that’s for sure. I’ve known this has helped me, even as a kid because I’ve tried almost everything else out there. I’ve just been waiting a long time for this but, I knew it would happen eventually. more"

I love the new update but have one complaint- I miss when you’d see the info on a strain, and it would show where it was nearby. They have seemed to remove this and it was a big plus for me when looking for strains. Now I search the strains and get all the info I need, but where I could get it close to me. I don’t know if they’re thinking about adding this back, but you really should!! It was such a help, like no idea how much.. because now I have to go into all the nearby dispensaries on the app and manually search for the strain and well let’s be honest.. I’m high most of the time and don’t have the time or am In the right state of mind to be able to do this. Other than that, I’m in love with everything that was done. I guess it was time for a makeover and y’all seemed to outdo yourselves. 5 stars for you! Being that this is the first review I’ve ever written in how many years?!

Designed by a practicing cardiologist, EchoLab provides a comprehensive framework for teaching the principles of quantitative echocardiography, or cardiac ultrasound. EchoLab's unique design permits sharing of entered and calculated data between its many formulas. Quick Entry views provide immediate access to a wide array of echocardiographic calculations. Unique to EchoLab among echocardiography applications is the powerful Analytic Engine, which synthesizes results from multiple calculations into a cohesive overview with a comprehensive summary, with integration of ASE/EACVI guidelines. The included companion app for the Apple Watch provides a ready reference when performing or interpreting echocardiograms. Available with each calculation is a graphical display of the corresponding mathematical equation, along with tips for using the calculation and medical literature references with integrated hyperlinks. Calculations and analyses include: • Aortic effective regurgitant orifice area • Aortic energy loss index • Aortic flow acceleration time with ratio to left ventricular ejection time • Aortic prosthetic paravalvular regurgitant extent • Aortic regurgitant fraction • Aortic regurgitant jet width, jet area, pressure half-time, and vena contracta • Aortic regurgitation index (for TAVR, from invasive pressure measurements) • Aortic root assessment • Aortic transvalvular flow rate • Aortic valve area (from velocity and velocity-time integrals, including dobutamine stress with projected aortic valve area) • Aortic valve resistance • Aortic valvulo-arterial impedance (Zva) • Biventricular coupling index • Body mass index • Body surface area • Cardiac output and ejection fraction (3D, area-length, Doppler, Dumesnil, Teichholz, simplified Quinones, and Simpson's methods) • Diastolic assessment (using either 2009 or 2016 guidelines for analysis) • Diastolic stress echocardiography • echocardiographic Pulmonary to Left Atrial Ratio (ePLAR) • Exercise stress echocardiography • Hemodynamic summary • Left atrial appendage emptying velocity • Left atrial pressure • Left atrial expansion index, function index, and reservoir strain • Left and right atrial volume and index • Left ventricular diastolic diameter index • Left ventricular dP/dt • Left ventricular fractional shortening • Left ventricular GLS • Left ventricular mass, mass index, and relative wall thickness • Left ventricular myocardial performance index • Left ventricular stroke work loss • Left ventricular wall motion score index • Maximum predicted heart rate (for dobutamine and exercise stress) • Maximum rate-pressure product (for exercise stress) • Mean arterial pressure • Mitral effective orifice area (PISA and stroke volume methods) • Mitral regurgitant fraction (PISA and stroke volume methods) • Mitral regurgitant vena contracta • Mitral valve area (continuity, PISA, and pressure half-time methods) • Mitral valve resistance • Mitral valvuloplasty score • Pericardial effusion (size and flow velocity paradoxus) • Prosthetic aortic and mitral valve assessment • Pulmonary artery systolic pressure (using tricuspid regurgitant velocity, VSD flow velocity, or pulmonary artery acceleration time), diastolic pressure, and mean pressure • Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure • Pulmonary vascular resistance • Right atrial pressure • Right ventricular-arterial coupling • Right ventricular function: dP/dt, fractional area change, free wall strain, index of myocardial performance, lateral annular plane systolic excursion, size, and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) • Shunt ratio (Qp:Qs) • Systemic vascular resistance • Tricuspid regurgitant vena contracta • Tricuspid valve area (pressure half-time method) EchoLab is a teaching and reference application, not a tool for clinical diagnosis, clinical decision-making, or echocardiography report generation. more",

I could easily request refills for any family member (including our pets) and I especially liked having a summary of what was ready at the pharmacy so I could double check that when I was picking up. This summer that summary disappeared. I had to manually open each individual family member’s name to see if any of their prescriptions were ready for pickup. Between the people and the pets there are 5 to manually look through. In the past few weeks there was a notice that all users must change their password. Okay. I did. Got in and used it as usual. The next time - all users must changed their password. I did again. Used the app. Then next time and every time following - every user must change their password. I’ve changed it 4 times and still getting that message. I gave up on it. Thankfully my pharmacy has a texting number so I can just text them when I need a refill. This app is useless! more"

I get fantastic, caring service from professionals who know my family’s medications and who will advise me directly about important side effects or drug interactions instead of making it my job to read the dense info included. But it feels like an early version of the app. I would like to support the developers with useful feedback without trashing the app in a review. Please allow in app feedback and a feedback channel on the website. Also, better documentation on the website would help. My husband is having trouble creating an account. He entered his correct information but was told it doesn’t match what the pharmacy has on file, which cannot be true. Also I’m trying to add family members. It asks for their Rx number. What is that? How do I discover or obtain one for them? Maybe explain more fully how to do something like that on the website. All you do there is step through the really obvious path as set forth in the app. So, I’d say communication with the developers and ways to get questions answered in more detail would be the first major change to make. more"

I don’t want my doctor contacted unless I authorize it. Furthermore, many medication’s are available generically and can be billed to a good RX or other coupon at the walk-in drugstore for less than insurance price or cash price. Express scripts is very greedy and they won’t honor these coupons. furthermore, they try to charge astronomical prices, calling certain medication’s specialty, when, in fact, they have many off label use and can be purchased for as little as $20 cash. Once your prescription is sent to Xpress scripts and not fillable thru insurance or their own incompetence or otherwise laziness, it’s impossible to get it back out of there easily. the only thing this service is good for is filling prescriptions that you have a refill on that are cheap, covered by insurance and need to be refilled regularly. The app needs many improvements. they should have to return to the customer a printed copy of every electronic prescription that they mishandle and do not fill in the manner requested by me, the customer. generics, utilize, or a 50-50 chance. You either get a quality one that is made in the USA, or end up with a very inexpensive generic, made outside of the USA. I haven’t tried to order a specific generic company, because I don’t want to be on hold for that long. more"

The virtual pharmacy ID card is not printable and does not contain all of the information the hard copy card has.

If you are looking to see your claims and history, or medicine history; you are out of luck. The search thinking wheel spins forever and almost always times out giving the message “9999: We are sorry, we are unable to complete your transaction at this time. Please try again later.”. Should you actually reach your history of any kind, forget actually printing it out. Pricing a medication by history is a long shot Only about 10 current medications show up and only about half of those are actually current up to date medications that you are taking. You better be an ace speller. If you misspell any drugs when searching within the app, the search is not smart and will not recognize even a close misspelled medication.

Sometimes it’s after an update, or when your fingerprint doesn’t register but password does. The support center actually recommends that you delete their app, then reinstall. This is under FAQ in the support Center online. Again, these are just small grievances of the APP, nothing that reflects on the overall plan itself. I simply wanted to layout why I only gave the app 4 stars. On a side note: I save an enormous amount of money by using their mail-order service. I think overall they are an excellent plan D for Medicare patients. more"

So thank you.With regards to not being able to rate a restaurant not on the site/app, we do have a link to \"Add a Restaurant\" under the \"more\" tab on the app. Frankly, the turnover in restaurants is always quite high, and much more so during the year of COVID. While we are taking steps to improve the accuracy of our listings going into 2021, we still rely on our community to help us in new and closed restaurants. If you click on Add a Restaurant and send the info to us, we will add it almost immediately to our database and then send you a return email letting you know it's ready for your review. I hope you'll take advantage of this. As you know, AllergyEats relies on user reviews - and finding positive reviews on new restaurants, especially during the pandemic, is even more valuable!With respect to other changes, while we believe in continuous improvement - and continue to practice that day-to-day - as you can imagine, we've been impacted by the pandemic quite dramatically, along with restaurants and travel. That said, we've upgraded our menu displays and look forward to more substantial improvements as people become more comfortable dining out again.Thank you again for your feedback and we'd of course love for you to reconsider your review.

        "review": "The free version is great. Allows you to create and print a spreadsheet of readings with 5 or 6 columns of info such as date, pulse, MAP, notes, weight, systolic and diastolic readings. You can write notes for each reading such as: took meds, did not take meds, or a highly stressful day. Can setup to automatically sync info to Health app. The MAP reading is especially helpful in giving an assessment of your arteries blood flow to major organs such as kidneys and brain. I have read that Doctors usually consider anything between 70 and 100 mmHg to be normal. All in all this a free app, which you can upgrade, that gives you basic useful information. more"

        "review": "App helps me maintain a diary of my BP & MAP (mean arterial pressure) w/ability to make notes on the present variables at the moment from exertion to medications to symptoms like chest pain. It automatically moves a copy of the results to a health app. Also I can look at weekly, monthly & annual trends. Highlighted results when my dbp (diastolic) or sbp (systolic) aren't in target range allows me to see quickly those variations which could signal a need for further attention or evaluation. So easy to add the data. Scroll to numbers rather than type in, weight can be adjusted anytime & notes can be added each reading. (Used to be an app whereby I could hold my iPhone to my chest for BP. Found it reliably close yo a BP machine. I deleted it only bc it wasn’t updated to current iPhone IOS. Miss that portable BP “cuff”.) Glad to use this app. Recommend for those wishing to maintain feedback for themselves OR their doctor bc info can be exported to another source for review. I don’t need that right now but I will have the baseline data when the time comes. Worthwhile! more"

A bit pricey (not going to be a $20 copay like a regular ol doctor visit) but it is SOOO worth it. Literally you can talk to a doctor either through video chat, phone, or text. I’m very anti social lol so I was so glad to just be able to text back and forth right away. No getting dressed, driving to the doctors office, waiting to be seen, etc. it’s literally right on your phone. For mild illnesses where you pretty much know what’s wrong & what you need but can’t get because it’s prescription only, this is great. I already knew what was going on with me & needed diflucan because OTC treatments don’t work for me. Told the doc my symptoms, he asked some questions, etc. and within about 5 minutes he sent a script over for diflucan to the pharmacy that I use & boom I picked it up an hour later. Love it. So much better than waiting a week just to get an appointment for my doctor, dragging myself there when I’m already miserable from whatever I got going on, & then waiting to be seen. more Hi there brina.124! Thank you for taking the time to leave us a review, we really appreciate it. We're so happy to hear that you found connecting with a doctor through HealthTap both convenient and enjoyable. We're so glad you were able to quickly get the care you need! We look forward to continuing to serve all your healthcare needs in the future. Hannah, Community Care Team more"

I didn’t have high hopes, but tonight I was freaking out about something in the middle of the night and was able to chat with a doctor. Dr. Pavel Conovalciuc was AWESOME at dealing with my paranoia, answered everything quickly and efficiently, and had excellent bedside manner. If you’re a hypochondriac like me and don’t have the time or money to CONSTANTLY go to the doctor for every little thing, this is fantastic. more Hello miss flack 3!

This starts with the app as I think the redesign from previous versions is a step up. Just the change of the logo and application color from red to blue brings a more tranquil experience to the user experience. The app is easy to navigate and searching for what you may want is less cumbersome. It is still easy to post a question for a physician to answer in case that is all you are interested in. For those who want more a big addition is the care guides which are guidelines set by a physician to reach a lifestyle goal whether it is to be healthy, get flat abs, care for your child, etc. The guides are easy to follow allowing users to enroll at the tap of a button. The app still makes it easy to centralize all of your health data but for those like myself who prefer to use another platform for this task, such as Apple Health, That data to can be incorporated. more"

That report only offers a color coded intensity - does not even include the average number for a more precise information. Also does not provide the most basic of analytics or insights like “on days you woke up without an alarm these symptoms were less”. You can compare symptom by symptom but only two at a time and only one day. Factors is also useless as it does not interact with the symptoms data at all, it might as well be part of the journal. When I messaged to ask about this they stated we don’t get into analyzing because it could be diagnosis. If you don’t offer diagnosis (an actual condition) and slap on the same warning like every other health app does then you aren’t diagnosing anything. It seems like an easy way to not do the work of actually processing the data in a meaningful way. This was a huge disappointment and I regret paying for this app and would like my money back. more"

        "review": "I am in recovery for a bad opiate problem I had. I have been clean and sober for going on 2 1/2 years I am very proud of myself for that it was extremely difficult. But the only reason I was able to do it is because of the treatment that I received from my doctor. I guess he is a psychiatrist and a treatment specialist. The meds that I have been taking I want gave me the ability to stop relying on the opiates. But my insurance was just recently canceled because I haven’t been able to work due to the coronavirus pandemic and my prescriptions were going to cost me about $350 a month on top of paying for my doctor visit every month I wouldn’t be able to afford that because of this pandemic. Fortunately somebody recommended good RX to me and it saved me $200 on my monthly meds. If it wasn’t for that I am afraid of what would happen to me if I did not have these meds. If it wasn’t for GoodRx I don’t know if I would be able to continue on the path that I am on which is the one I want to stay on if you need some help getting your prescriptions I recommend good RX to you.

        "review": "I have been purchasing prescriptions (and some OTC drugs, which require a prescription) through Good Rx Gold and Good Rx Coupons, for about 6 or 7 months. I purchased the “Individual” plan, and I consider it as the best $5.99 per month that I have ever spent. To be clear, I have saved over $1300 in drug costs, since I began my subscription. To say that I am “Blown Away” would be putting it mildly!!! The one drawback is that one may have to use several different pharmacies to purchase his/her medications. This is because the drugs have different costs at different pharmacies. HOWEVER, with the amazing app and by inputting the formulary, one knows the cost of the drug (or an excellent approximation), prior to making the purchase. This may be a little inconvenient for the doctor, because to order a prescription electronically, they would first have to share their purchase plan with the patient (so that the patient can determine where would be the best price). However, I have yet to have a doctor to complain about having to do this, because I think that they know how much savings are realized by their patients. BRAVO, GOOD RX and GOOD RX GOLD!!! more"

        "review": "GoodRx advertises savings on drugs not covered by insurance and their pricing is lower than the cost of the drug to the pharmacy. One has to ask why would a pharmacy sign up to lose money. Big Y Foods pharmacy answer I found out was that they did not sign up with GoodRx. CVS answer was we will not honor the GoodRx price but they referred me to Walgreen who would honor the price but first needed the prescription to verify the price. They tried to have the prescription transferred from a Walmart pharmacy and had a problem but never contacted me. I called and they explained why they did not have the prescription. I told them how to fix the issue and reminded them not to order the prescription until they quoted me a price. I stopped by Walgreen’s pharmacy a few days later and found they ordered me the name brand drug for $1,000. GoodRx quotes Walgreens’ at $177. I declined the name brand drug and they then ordered the generic. While I was there I had the store clerk quickly verify the GoodRx price and he placed the order for the next day. I am puzzled why they couldn’t verify the price of the generic over the phone initially? But perseverance of multiple phone calls, confusion about prescription transfer, filling a prescription incorrectly but the end result was I saved $473. GoodRx is not easy but if you have the time and energy for quite a run around you too can save money with GoodRx. more Hi there, we're sorry to hear about the issue you've experienced at the pharmacy.

        "review": "First off, I love the new look of the app. It is very clean. Some things that should be added are like the ability to change what kind of mapping app you use when you hit the Navigate button. Second of all, you should have the ability to have custom tones for different calls. Some that you put in the app and then somewhere where other people can make custom tones. Next, you should have accounts, so that people can save calls, and have alerts for specific stations and departments. You also should include like an on scene button for CPR alerts that will send a notification to dispatch saying that someone is on scene that knows how to do COR. That good with the account idea, and the next idea which is an area where you have to be CPR certified to get CPR notifications. Have a list of places that you can get certified, but only allow people with CPR certification to get notified. Finally, I just want to say how much I love this app, it has helped me out so much with stuff. Thank you for making this app. It's awesome. more"

        "review": "All of my coworkers use this app. About 1600 of them! It works great giving us a jump on emergencies. It’s almost perfect. Except....I don’t use it at night along with many others. There are way too many incidents throughout the night all over the city. I would be up all night if I leave on all of the notifications. It’s like listening to radio dispatch tone after tone and most of the time isn’t you. I would love to see settings for individual companies. For example, if you set your company as Engine 1, your phone would notify you if the incident involved E1. The phone could be set to ring, vibe and/or even turn on your phone light for a length of time. With today’s technology it shouldn’t be that difficult to accomplish. This would also be a great option during the day. Every report of a fire notification has fireman on edge for several seconds and we all pull our phones out to see the location. Most of the time it involves other stations and a majority of them end up being nothing. There is no reason to continuously alert members for a run they are not on for no reason, unless they choose too. Love the app and will continue to use it, but sorry PulsePoint, you are not user friendly when we need to get some sleep. Columbus, OH more"

The app does spam a couple pop-ups saying “Location Required - Pulse Point needs access to your location for this feature. Please update your app settings under the “Privacy” menu.” This is on the feed page which also says I’m not subscribed to any feeds, even though I am. You have to select the pull down menu towards the top-center to select the subscribed feeds. It is confusing and I don’t recall having to do this before. Anyway it works, but minus one star for the extra step and misleading message. Used this app almost daily but now I have to delete it. They went from letting you put in your chosen location and following the relevant agencies to demanding you always let them know your location. There’s no reason to make that setting mandatory to use the basic functions except for data gathering. I get that some people want notifications, but not everyone wants to hand over personal information to a faceless corp. It’s a shame they decided to do this. Hope they make a way to allow for more privacy in the future. more No such change or condition exists. Please reach out to support@pulsepoint.org and they’ll help you sort it out. more"

        "review": "So I originally got this app with my 1st pregnancy, but I didn’t pay for the premium because at the time I thought it was bonkers to pay $4.99 for a pregnancy app when all the other pregnancy apps are free. I decided to purchase the app with my current pregnancy back when so found out I was pregnant in August 2020. I KNOW I paid for the app because I would not have been able to use a majority of the features however.... when I decided that I wanted to make a birth plan and use the app to do it, it says I have to purchase the premium for $1.99 which I couldn’t understand because I paid $4.99 for premium. Every once in a while I’ll have apps that do this so I’ll just tap “restore” and it restores my purchase and everything is fine. NOT WITH THIS APP. I tapped “restore” and a message pops up that says “Alert: You have not purchased the app.” YES I HAVE PURCHASED THE APP. This leads me to think that even though you have to pay $4.99 for the premium, there is also an additional $1.99 charge for the premium that they have snuck in making this app actually $6.98.

As predicted, everything on the app is user friendly— you can just take a picture of your prescription, enter your mailing info, and with just one click they’re ready to process your order and ship it out to you! I cannot say enough nice things about this company. My entire family orders contacts from them— very reliable and superb customer service!!! more"

I’m having the hardest time placing an order for contacts. Maybe it’s weird that I have two different prescriptions, one for extended wear clear contacts, and one for prescription colored contacts. They keep putting my order “on hold” and prompting me to take an express exam through then for $20. I don’t need it because my Rx was renewed last week. When I contacted them via text, they quickly assumed I was stupid and ordered the wrong contacts. I told them, no, that I actually had two prescriptions, then they said they had the paper but would verify no matter what ( ok, fine) but it was as if I was lying, even though I literally uploaded the thing three times. Very short w me and canceled the order per my request because I felt like they’d leave it languishing forever. My initial order worked just fine for whatever reason. I wonder if they think I’m lying since I was in a free trial with the colors when I ordered the extended wear. I don’t know. But they definitely treated me like they thought I was dumb. more"

I was previously using the Accu-check application for several years, even though I had also downloaded this one. My original view of the application, was that it wouldn’t automatically transfer the previous data stored on my device, or from the online database. I had unfortunately missed the sunset deadline to manually make the transition, I had temporarily stopped tracking my sugar, which was a big mistake. By the time I remembered why I keep feeling spacey was probably due to either a sugar high or an excessive low, which was mostly the case. I quickly found out that my favorite app “Accu-Check” was retired and replaced with the “My Sugar” app. I had missed the Free “PRO transfer offer period”, and proceeded to set-up and sink my account and device. I was quickly pleased, after syncing my device, I found that everything stored on my monitor transferred completely. I was so excited. I have since explored the app, and see where I can add additional details about my day, including my current weight, pictures of meals, how I feel and more. This is one of the absolute best Sugar apps on the market, which works with a large variety’s of blood glucose meters! more"

Being able to see and really analyze what causes the ups and downs in my blood sugar, and really think about what is happening at that moment I’m logging a reading. Im by no means an expert on the subject of how to properly manage this disease. But now I have a much greater understanding of all the conditions, aswell as the actions that can contribute to me feeling great or terrible. I’ve been in denial for some time of what causes the good or bad days. This highly animated app gives a very reasonable and realistic approach to wanting to dig into the data. It’s only as good as what you log. And how honest you can be with yourself, and hold yourself accountable to logging the truth about your day, your activities, stresses, mood, anxiety, and poor food/drink decisions. Something as simple as seeing and comparing how different levels of activity affect your blood sugar is not only good in real time, but also to be able to go back and identify patterns, good, bad, and sometimes the ugly. This app has served me well, and I am grateful for it. Hopefully you will see the positives for yourself as well. Cheers to your good path to better health. more"

I tried 6 different apps and this one trounced the competition at the time. That was 3 years ago, and since then, the app has gotten better in many ways. This service and development teams are incredible. Super-responsive, they understand when you have issues and and I’m constantly impressed with how quickly they’re able to implement changes and get them out to their users. One complaint about a recent change: If you have a meter that syncs entries directly with the app, you no longer have the ability to adjust the time of the entry. I liked to do this for times when I end up waiting 15-45 mins after testing to take my pre-meal shot, since getting precise timing of insulin injections is more important than precise timing of BG readings while fasting. Sadly, this is no longer an option and instead the only option is to delete the synced entry and recreate it manually, which is MUCH more painful. I wish they would restore users’ the ability to manage their own data how they see fit. more Hi! Wow, thank you so much for the great review. We are so glad you found us and that you have stayed happy with our products and service. Keep up the great work and we've got your back! more"

        "review": "It's amazing to me how few BP apps include the ability to track factors that might be contributing to BP problems! The flexibility of the tagging features in this app allows you to tag & track - then graph- whatever you want: stress levels, salty diet, major public events (I noticed my BP spike for days after Las Vegas shooting), specific medications or supplements, caffeine intake, etc. It has helped me learn that for me, salt seems almost irrelevant and stress is about 80% of the problem. I'm now tracking Toprol closely as I think I might be having an uncommon but not unheard of paradoxical reaction, with more Toprol raising my BP. DEVELOPER SUGGESTIONS: ... TAGGING: It would be really helpful if tags could be ordered; if not, it would be helpful if list were at least alphabetized. Also would like to be able to ditch some of the tags provided by app......DEFAULTS: Being able to set defaults for measurement site and measurement location would speed input nicely!......BONUS: The ability to have multiple profiles would be nice. Some of us have non-smartphone-using elderly parents to track! Thanks for a great app!! more Update 8/22/22: Hello there! We have addressed all your requests.

Looking at that big white screen full of blank space, I wonder why they didn’t use the space more intelligently. I am a senior citizen with new glasses last month, but I can’t comfortably read anything on the screen in this app without magnification or massive eyestrain. If the developers intended to make this app only for younger folks with 20/20 vision, fine,…but don’t write off all of the seniors and people with vision challenges who suffer with blood pressure and/or heart rate issues. I’m going back to my iPad Notes app where I can set the text size to a comfortable level, and simply input the readings on the keyboard. I use symbols to allow my doctor to quickly see where the HR was too low (🤍), the systolic or systolic was too low. or both were too low (🔻🔻). I have different symbols for hypertension, and this method has worked well for me. If you upgrade to a variable typeface, I may try again, as the graphing ability is a convenient feature. Even that was so small and faint , so I struggled to see it.

You can set this in the “limit classification” within the more section of the app. Make sure to consult your doctor to review the current 2017 ACC/AHA classification before changing to the custom.

I’ve been paying for months and when I needed to see a dentist, it turned out they had closed a long ago. Then I tried updating to a different dentist in the Guardian network and they didn’t have a working phone number or email address. I’m really worried about my teeth and I’m not able to see a dentist because Guardian keeps offering closed offices to me. Also, the website takes 2-3 business days to update anything so it kept telling me I had outstanding payments and I paid it multiple times before realizing that submitting payments through the website doesn’t change the status on the website. more"

This app does not replace the original manuscript of these landmark critical care trials – instead, it serves as a fast reference and learning tool for some of the most important ICU trials over a wide range of specialties. Each entry contains a short one-liner about the critical care trial and key points, which includes only the most pertinent details, such as inclusion/exclusion criteria, treatment protocols, pertinent endpoints and findings, as well as expert commentary regarding key subgroup analyses or limitations to the trial. Want to send a colleague a citation? Use the \"Share Trial\" button to send a PubMed link and quick summary. Using this feature, it’s incredibly easy to share pivotal critical care trials with students, residents, and other colleagues. The database features 150+ landmark trials related to: ARDS, cardiac arrest, DVT/PE, delirium, glycemic control, heart failure, hemorrhage, meningitis, nephroprotection, nutrition, pneumonia, sedation, seizure, sepsis/shock, spinal cord injury, stroke, and subarachnoid hemorrhage – with more trials and topics to be added on a regular basis!

Entering products/calories is also easy, so I’m more likely to keep up with it. Before I restored, I had an older version of the app that offered the slim down avatar and the weight chart for free - those were both super motivating as well! I’m debating upgrading to pro just so I can get those features back. The quotes and panic button were also super helpful to me in the beginning when I was struggling to break habits and cravings. LOVE it! It’s the only app that works for me because it doesn’t get boring. If anything, more options for clothes (or replacing some of the clothes with more trendy versions) would be my main request. I plateaued and regained weight after a super successful year (now I’m successfully restarting)... part of it was the plateau, but I also think part of it was because I’d chosen all of the clothes/accessories I liked and wanted, so I became disengaged. Awesome for short term/teaching goals, but I would LOVE features to make it an app I can use for years, and something to keep me more engaged after I reach my goals would’ve been awesome to keep me from regaining the 40 lbs I lost using the app. more"

This app helped me lose 30 pounds without having to deprive myself of any specific food group. I entered my present weight, my goal and it calculated the healthy amount of weight for me to lose each week. All I had to do was log in what I had each meal. It gives you an option to take a picture of your meal, in case you don’t have time to log it right away. It has a huge database of foods already stored, so it’s easy to pull that information. It also gives you the macros for each meal or item. For me, it was a huge wake up call. I was completely off in my portions and the app told me the truth about the calories I was consuming. The best is that I can have a piece of cake if I monitor closely what I have the rest of the day. If you’re serious about losing weight and keeping it off (which is the hardest part), this app will be invaluable. Make it a part of your daily routine and in time you’ll do it with your eyes closed. Don’t go for fad diets that deprive you of a whole food group. It’s unsustainable, unhealthy, and ineffective. I give this app five stars. As a bonus, my kids love playing dress up with the doll.

I would highly recommend getting the pro version in order to take advantage of all the features. This app also includes a game-like leveling system in which you earn points for sticking with it. I like this system a lot, but there is one thing I would change about it: the fashion items. As you earn points, the game gives you clothing items to put on your avatar, but these clothing items are generated randomly and most of them don't fit the avatar well at all. I'm trying to lose weight - I don't want to plaster my ideal self with ill fitting clothes that make her look bigger than she is! I wish that the fashion items actually fit the avatar, and I wish that I could see a list of items to buy and save up my points to get the things I really want. Sometimes that would be all the motivation I would need to do a few extra squats or drink a little bit more water. Other than that, this app is a wonderful tool that has already helped me lose weight and be more mindful of myself. more"

        "review": "I switched to Ovia after my previous phone had to be restored. And ever since then I have loved Ovia. Overall I think it’s the neatest and easiest way to track anything your body is going through. My only complaint is that when it predicts the day your period is supposed to start and your period doesn’t come, I nit that it didn’t start that specific day and the day predicted for it to start changes right away to the next day. I wish the predictions would still show on the calendar while actually pinning down the days that it actually started along with the days that it was supposed to based on your previous trends. Besides that, I would highly recommend it! All the features such as adding in your symptoms, how you’ve been feeling, and the question/answer section is absolutely helpful when you are wanting to know about something! Asking users who also use Ovia and most likely have gone through what you’re going through has helped me answer questions about whether what I was going through was normal or something I should be worried about. And I also love the fact that when you conceive the app switches over to one that you can use while pregnant and after while knowing and keeping track of your past activities. I would choose Ovia if you’re needing an app like it! more"

        "review": "I started using the Ovia Fertility app initially to track my periods and get a sense of my cycle before my husband and I were ready to TTC (I had a copper IUD so I wanted to be able to track the changes once it was removed). As a period tracker and as a fertility tracker once we were TTC it was super useful for the most part. I agree with other reviewers that I would some way (other than me writing it in as note) to mark when I’m late for an expected period instead of the app just resetting the cycle count. Overall I’m happy with the app when I’m TTC and I loved the sister pregnancy app. Unfortunately, I’ve had two miscarriages and neither app does a good job in handling those. With my first one, I ended up having to mark it as a “period” to track the bleeding and stop the app from telling me to take a pregnancy test. After we got the second positive test, I found out the pregnancy app hadn’t updated itself from the first loss. It was an emotional sucker punch to log in and be told that I was only a couple of weeks away from my original due date. With this second loss, and again despite informing the apps of the miscarriage, nothing has changed in my fertility app. I don’t want to mark it as a period but the app now has me on some crazy cycle day. I don’t want to reset everything and lose all the data but it needs to have a system in place to track these without creating huge outlier cycles... more"

    "appDescription": "About the Diagnostic Test Calculator This diagnostic test calculator is of value to clinicians and researchers who wish to understand the accuracy and reliability of a diagnostic test. The application can determine test characteristics including specificity, sensitivity and likelihood ratio. Easy to navigate input fields allow the user to analyse a diagnostic test quickly and effectively. The results of the diagnostic test calculator display the post-test probability of disease given the pre-test probability of the characteristics of the specific diagnostic test. Results are shown as absolute values and also as an easy to use graph (nomogram) and summary table. The app gives you a clear analysis and also, given a sample size, will show the confidence intervals clearly. The nomogram itself will display the probability that the patient actually has the disease after a positive or negative test. This Diagnostic Test Calculator iPhone application is supported by a grant from Gilead Sciences Europe. The calculations within the app are based on the open source implementation which can be found at http://araw.mede.uic.edu/cgi-alansz/testcalc.pl (Copyright (c) 2002-2007 by Alan Schwartz alansz@uic.edu).

I went through the regular cardiac tests..... stress test, blood work, EKG, echo, and 48 hour mobile heart monitoring. The palpitations and rapid heart rate did not surface during these test. How discouraging, because my symptoms were real but not solid proof. My cardiologist was concerned but not convinced there could be a problem. I mean after all doctors work with concrete facts. I remembered I had a Kardia, AliveCor Mobile EKG which I had purchased a year or so before these symptoms to help with my mother's heart tracking. I started monitoring my palpitations with the view to sharing the results with my doc. I also used the device when I started to have longer rapid heart rate episodes which were sporadic and usually occurred when the Doc's office was closed. (Who can run to the doctor at a moments notice and get in? Not me) Bingo! Proof that my symptoms were real. I printed out the EKG records I had taken with my Kardia, faxed them to my cardiologist, and received a call the same day with the diagnosis of Afib. I truly believe a correct diagnosis came about faster, without a possible emergency room visit, and in the comfort/safely at home only because of this fabulous device and easy to use app. For under a hundred dollars it's the BEST investment in my and my family's health I have made. more"

        "review": "I have had atrial fibrillation for a number of years. During that time if I felt anything “off” I went to the ER. After relaxing and working with meditation all the symptoms went away every time. The doctors seemed to be as surprised as I was. There were many false alarms. At the hospital I was routinely checked-out. With 20 minutes of meditation all the systems were normal. My cardiologist was pleased with how I was being proactive. He showed me the Kardia app and I purchased it that day. The app gave me such peace of mind. I could use it to determine if I was having a heart event and needed to relax and check again to determine if I needed to go to the ER. Now, which is two years later, I have done routine daily readings and I’ve had no sign of a-fib except two times. I sent the results for an immediate reading and feedback. 20 minutes later—but using meditation and quietly coping whatever was going wrong had already resolved any concerns before my results even had been reported back to me. I keep my yearly check-ups and I’m doing great. Given my experience I recommend the Kardia app. It’s a great tool in your fight with heart disease. It’s peace of mind and no false alarm trips to the ER. It’s a huge piece of what I do to stay well and deal with my heart irregularities in a very wise way.

Treatment of A-fib is vital in preventing strokes, death, and disability. I was able to determine my skipped beats were not PVC’s from coffee consumption but PJC’s and probable culprit taking more levothyroxine than my thyroid levels warrant (plus my old pal, caffeine). Got my thyroid levels checked and Bingo! The intrinsic interpretation function will not give you that kind of diagnosis (only gives normal or not, a-fib or not options) unless you pay for an expert interpretation ($19) or get Premium package. If you can read ECG’s already, then this can help identify PSVT vs rapid A-fib, and many other dysrhythmias. No substitute for going to your provider, but the ability to share your rhythm strip is REALLY INVALUABLE. Option to carry it on your phone is brilliant because folks always have phones on their person to capture evrnts. I have added it to my first aid kit. Home health agencies should be using these and anyone doing wellness checks on older adults. I wonder how many lives this tool has saved, and how many strokes it has prevented? Amazing!

So far, I think getting the app was a good choice. The diary is especially nice, allowing you to do quick ratings to track symptoms through the day. The food information is helpful, but I was a bit perplexed at the differences between the FODMAP info on some vegetables, since a good book on FODMAP suggests that (for example) broccoli, green beans, and cabbage should be avoided during elimination, but the app says they are okay. Because Monash has done the testing, though, I assume I have come to the “horse’s mouth,” so to speak. I was hoping for the price that the guide would be a bit more detailed, and I thought some foods (like yellow cooking onions, which are widely available in the US) would be included. But the strength of the app is in the recording features, and it is very cool that you can filter out food chemicals that bother you, and that the app provides a systematic way to track reintroduction, with a bit of guidance about amounts.

I wouldn't give feedback this way, but the Feedback link does not work on the app!!! and there is no way to get a hold of them anywhere. Even if you Google this app and go to the webpage, there's no way to communicate with them. This is an extremely easy fix to make the links work. Another example of where they work is they have a certified section where they list food partners, and it is almost impossible to get those links to work. And now I will confess that this is a super useful app. Several times a day I go on here to receive the bad news that I can't eat something or like anything 🤣 if I can make some feature suggestions, it would be great to see the data organized in terms of, what CAN I eat? For instance, I want to see a list of vegetables that I can eat. A lot of or a medium amount of they have enough data to make a slider where you can say vegetable and moderate FODMAP or very low FODMAP. Also, the recipe should be billed out more. There's only a few of them. Thanks for your work, university. LASTLY it is very confusing that on the food index page, the green red orange dots do not consistently go in ascending or descending order, it is different for each item. They should all go in ascending order or they should all go in descending order. That makes this already frustrating situation even more confusing. more Hi there - we're sorry to hear that you are experiencing issues with accessing links on our app! We'd love to get some further information from you about these issues - please contact us at enquiry@monashfodmap.com. We also apologise that you found it hard to reach out to us - our website is a direct way to ensure we receive your questions: www.monashfodmap.com/contact-us/ We appreciate the feedback in regard to organising the data according to what you can eat - we do have the filter function which can alter the traffic lights to reflect your tolerances, but we can investigate other sorting options also. In the past we have limited the number of recipes so the app doesn't take up a huge amount of storage on people's phones, but we hope to add more recipes in the app in the near future. Finally regarding the traffic light order - they have been arranged as such is that it reflects the overall traffic light rating allocated to the food. For example, a food with an overall red rating will start with a red and have serving sizes listed in descending order, and vice versa. We hope this further information helps and we again sincerely appreciate your feedback. We hope to hear from you via email soon. Best wishes more"

Like I’ve noticed multiple recipes don’t have some measurements of ingredients listed which is mind boggling that you forgot simple numbers on things. I’m also highly frustrated not knowing what bread I can and cannot eat since there are a few contradictions in the food search regarding that. And I know you can’t add every food known to man, but knowing I can look up anything would be nice (even if it’s obvious I shouldn’t eat it...ex. marshmellos). Also in the recipes, it would be nice to know how many you can actually eat of the thing...like what is the serving size for each recipe because I had like 3 rice paper wraps and my stomach was in turmoil that night. This diet is already hard and frustrating enough so when I pay $8 to make it easier, I need it to be worth it. I’ll end with saying that overall this app is quite nice and helpful and reduces my anxiety knowing it’s certified but small things that can help and be fixed should be, specially if you’re going to charge me for an app that helps with an only ever temporary diet. more"

I like that I can read a bio about my doctors before I choose to work with them.

Haven’t needed to use it for a medical visit yet but I would totally use this app if I needed an antibiotic or something like that vs having to go into my normal primary care office and waiting an hour or more. The only downfall to this app is that you cannot get in touch with doctors between appointments. I can imagine why that is, but it would be so awesome if it had a messaging or voicemail service, even if they charged per message or had limitations on how often/what you could use it for. more"

If it had not been for Dr on Demand I would have had to find an urgent care center somewhere, wait hours in a room filled with other sick people and would’ve paid far more just to be told what I already intuitively know...that I have a head cold and an ear infection. These factors are what usually kept me from going to urgent care and getting the treatment I probably needed. Can you imagine being in a foreign country, not speaking the language, having to weather snow and ice on foot while you try to make your way to a hospital in a country where you don’t have insurance coverage, alone, only to have to trek back to your hotel and find the nearest pharmacy on the way? It’s a big deterrent. Now, with Dr on Demand, I can do it from the comfort of my hotel room and the app will locate the closest pharmacy. Today, this app and the wonderful doctor kept me from flying with a middle ear infection and risking potentially blowing an ear drum, which would have resulted in permanent hearing loss. I waited less than two minutes and the appointment probably only took five minutes. This is my new, most favorite health app! Everyone should download it and have it ready for when they need it. more"

        "review": "This app is great if you can’t find someone in network near you with your insurance, or you don’t have insurance. You don’t have to go anywhere or wait forever for an appointment! You can be seen in under 5 minutes depending on the doctor and what time you need help. You can also see lots of different types of doctors. With that being said, my only cons to this app would be that if you want mental health from a psychiatrist, YOU CANNOT GET CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES FROM THESE DOCTORS!! So if you are on anti anxieties or something for ADHD, for example, they won’t be able to write you an RX. However, any other medication they can and will prescribe. My other only con would be the site/app itself, charging you for your appointment up front. Then if your insurance covers telehealth visits, you either have to wait to be reimbursed or figure out how to you’re getting your money back….it’s just a hassle to have to pay up front every time and then wait a month or longer to see what your insurance is going to do….Otherwise, this is way better than sitting in an office waiting area for however long, or having to take off work during normal 9-5ish hours, since a lot of these tele docs have later hours! This is NOT an ER, or anywhere for emergency care!!! Please don’t think it is!!! If you need stitches, you will need to see someone in person, and ASAP before you bleed out!!! Lol more"

In that time I’ve had a couple of surgeries, mental health appointments, ER visits, 2 hospital stays, medical appointments, drug & alcohol abuse rehab, prescriptions, annual physicals, etc, etc & being a person with ADHD it helps me tremendously with keeping all my important heath info together, organized, situated, handy, easy to understand & access…ANYWHERE at that! It’s fantastic & has been super helpful in tracking my heath informations making my appointments efficient - I leave feeling heard, confident, knowledgeable - like I got my $ worth. My Dr’s are able to treat me comprehensively because they’re fully informed, & are happy to respectfully hear me out as a patient because they can see I care about my health. It’s a win-win all around. I highly recommend this app. Thank you developers, from the bottom of my heart. I truly love your app. ❤️ more"

        "review": "There is a new setting where the app does not allow appointments less than one year into the future. My son is 8 months old and needs multiple wellness exams within a year, but I get an error message after entering in all my information and it doesn’t allow me to book, requiring me to call my provider. This app also doesn’t handle rescheduling. To change an appointment I need to call my provider. And even then, I still get app and email reminders of an appointment that has been canceled. It makes me have to double check calendars and send messages to my provider to confirm the correct appointment or ensure one has been canceled. These issues have happened multiple times. I wish the app would remove the canceled appointment and not send reminders. I also would like to book my regular wellness exams through the app without getting errors. The UI for visit summary and the log for immunizations could also use improvement. I’d also appreciate the option to add an attachment to a message. For example, I wasn’t able to share a screenshot of my scheduling error. It would also be nice to select any provider (no preference) and schedule based on date/time available. Currently you have to click through each provider and their availability and cannot browse all doctors based on a date/time. more We're sorry to hear that you've had a negative experience with our product.

        "review": "If you happen to have one or more healthcare providers who are forcing you to use the Healow app and/or portal for communication with your doctor, lab results, prescription, refills, etc. — good luck! After you synch a more than a couple healthcare practices and patients (your children for example) and user names and passwords, the app can no longer access all of them without glitching or giving you a constant error. You cannot call and speak to a human at customer support. I tried, and they told me they could not help me — that I had to go through the website. So, I spent hours online and emailing with tech support only to not resolve anything and have them make suggestions that were not helpful — something that would’ve been much easier to navigate with an actual conversation. Healow, then closed my case, emailing me telling me they’d resolved my issue (nothing was resolved). My doctor’s office has also tried to troubleshoot unsuccessfully and can’t figure it out. So, communication with this particular practice is a constant problem and source of frustration. This is supposed to make my healthcare more accessible and easier to navigate. If anything, it is the exact opposite. The app works for the first two practices I used Healow for, but every healthcare practice added after that has not worked properly — if at all. more We apologize for any inconvenience our product may have caused you.

The IVUSAID App is a free educational mobile application which has been developed to teach medical professionals how to use intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) for PCI guidance based on the current guidelines using our extensive experience and large database of complex coronary cases. Despite the growing body of evidence for clinical benefits of IVUS-guided PCI, IVUS remains underutilized in much of the world including the United States. Challenges in image interpretation and education are among the barriers to widespread adoption of IVUS in everyday clinical practice. Mount Sinai Heart is a global leader within the field of interventional cardiology as well as mobile apps development. The myriad of cases and pathology which are seen in The Mount Sinai Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory make it the perfect center to educate medical professionals within this field. The Key Concepts section of IVUSAID describes principles of IVUS, image acquisition, and concepts of ultrasound behavior in various tissues. The Image Interpretation section of the app has dozens of representative cross-sectional images, videos, and descriptions of plaque types, stent apposition and expansion, artifacts, and more. A short video for each type of lesion or artifact and post-stent findings, in addition to an annotated representative cross section aims to overcome a major limitation of any article or book on IVUS which present a static image, since the actual IVUS pullback is dynamic. Twenty-one complex coronary cases demonstrate IVUS guidance in a variety of patient presentations and lesions including ACS, LM bifurcation, severely calcified lesions and calcified nodules, spontaneous coronary artery dissection, and malapposed stents as well as how IVUS was used to inform treatment decisions. An extensive quiz section helps deliver educational content in a more interactive format where answers are accompanied by detailed explanations and references. We hope that IVUSAID will help techs, fellows, and early-career physicians incorporate IVUS in their daily practice for stent sizing, post-stent optimization, and identification of appropriate treatment strategies. more",

    "appDescription": "The CSWG App is a comprehensive tool with three distinct parts and provides valuable calculators to assist clinical decision-making. Part 1: Cardiogenic Shock Working Group Shock Stage Calculator The first page of the app features the Cardiogenic Shock Working Group Shock Stage Calculator. This calculator utilizes the CSWG-SCAI shock stage classification system to determine the severity of cardiogenic shock. It provides an accurate assessment of the shock stage, along with the predicted mortality rate for each stage. Additionally, the calculator presents separate mortality predictions for myocardial infarction-related cardiogenic shock (MI-CS) and heart failure-related cardiogenic shock (HF-CS). Furthermore, it offers a predicted probability of stage escalation. Part 2: Invasive Hemodynamics Calculator The second page of the app houses the Invasive Hemodynamics Calculator. This powerful tool enables healthcare professionals to calculate various important parameters related to hemodynamics. With this calculator, users can determine parameters such as cardiac output using the Fick method, cardiac index, cardiac power output, cardiac power index, pulse pressure, aortic pulsatility index, systemic vascular resistance, mean pulmonary artery pressure, right atrial pressure/pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, pulmonary artery pulsatility index, right ventricular stroke work index, transpulmonary gradient, and diastolic pulmonary gradient. Additionally, the calculator generates a graph that plots left heart filling pressure (PCWP) and right heart filling pressure (CVP or RAP) to aid in the classification of parameters into categories such as \"LV congestion,\" \"RV congestion,\" \"Hypovolemic,\" and \"BiV Congestion.\" Part 3:Congestion Profile Tracking Plot left heart filling pressure (PCWP) and right heart filling pressure (CVP or RAP) to aid in the classification of parameters into categories such as \"LV congestion,\" \"RV congestion,\" \"Hypovolemic,\" and \"BiV Congestion.\" Plot points longitudinally to see trends over time. Part 4: CSWG-SCAI Shock Phenotype Calculator The final part of the app is the CSWG-SCAI Shock Phenotype Calculator. This calculator is designed to determine the shock phenotype based on specific characteristics and clinical indicators. It classifies the shock phenotype into three categories: phenotype I (non-congested), phenotype II (cardio-renal), and phenotype III (cardiometabolic). Additionally, the calculator provides a predicted in-hospital mortality rate for each phenotype, aiding clinicians in risk stratification and treatment planning. The CSWG App for iOS consolidates essential calculators and predictive capabilities in a user-friendly interface, offering a valuable resource for healthcare professionals involved in the management of cardiogenic shock. By facilitating accurate assessments, providing hemodynamic insights, and assisting in the determination of shock phenotypes, this app aims to optimize patient care and outcomes in the challenging context of cardiogenic shock. Please note that this app only presents data published in the literature and should not be a substitute for clinical decision making. The treating clinician/team should use their judgement and experience in clinical decision making. more",

    "appDescription": "An instant guide to Valve in Valve procedures for clinicians Quick, clear and concise information about heart valves and Valve in Valve therapy. A guide you wish you always had at your fingertips. About Valve in Valve app was originally developed as a collaboration between the technology company UBQO and Dr. Vinayak (Vinnie) Bapat, Consultant Cardiac Surgeon at St. Thomas' Hospital, London, UK. The team at KRUTSCH reimagined the app, introducing modern design, as well as a novel editing interface for to allow cardiologists to edit cloud-hosted valve data. Valve in Valve app provides information specific for a clinical scenario, quickly and simply. This will help in the planning of and performing a Valve in Valve case. The application navigates the user through important aspects of surgical and TAVR valve design, which are vital for a successful Valve in Valve procedure. The app logically steps through the possible combinations to give the user specific information needed to perform the procedure. Success of a Valve in Valve procedure is based on correct identification of the surgical valve, choosing the correct size of the TAVR valve and its subsequent accurate placement. Surgical valves vary in appearance under fluoroscopy and also in their internal diameter. Similarly TAVR valves differ in their appearances and available sizes. Knowledge about all the surgical valves that have been implanted in the last two decades is minimal but relevant to the Valve in Valve therapy. Users can now familiarise themselves with important design information about surgical and TAVI valves; they can also select the valve and find out which size of TAVR valve could be used and how it is best placed during a Valve in Valve procedure. If the valve type is unknown, the App also guides the user through a series of steps where they can identify the surgical valve type and then use the information available for it. The Valve In Valve app can be used to plan a case and confirm suitability for this procedure and reduces the need to trawl through vast amounts of literature to find information specific to the clinical scenario. The information is also available without the need for an internet connection and will enhance the users understanding of various aspects of this procedure. We hope this will result in improved results and better outcomes for patients. Key features - Design information for multiple types of surgical valve - Sizing information for multiple types of surgical valve - Real life and fluoroscopic images of all the surgical valves - Design information about TAVR valve designs - Sizing information for these TAVR valves - Guides the user through a stepped process to help choose a specific valve, then the size and lastly the important dimensions to plan a Valve in Valve procedure - Image based guidance for the ideal placement of a TAVR valve - Video examples of actual placement of a TAVR valve - Discusses important design considerations in detail to improve understanding of the Valve in Valve procedure more",

        "review": "This app is one of the strangest things I’ve ever experienced. Strange, because I don’t understand how it exists. It doesn’t make sense. I was almost sure it wouldn’t really work, or that it would be terrible doctors. I mean it’s an app. How am I going to get real and personal medical care downloaded from the Apple store. But...it’s...real somehow. I really waited just a few minutes (instead of days or weeks for my pcp) and a doctor pops on my screen. (To be fair, I haven’t asked for their license #s and checked it up yet- but hoping that since its connected to a large insurance company, they wouldn’t risk the huge lawsuits of hiring fake doctors). So far they seem competent and have been on the mark with the diagnoses. But here’s the strangest part. I kept waiting for the bills to come in the mail. They never did. So I checked my invoices in the app and it said $0.00 What??? How is this free? Is it just a benefit for paying my insurance premiums? Sheesh. so worth it. So long as I can afford it, I’m sticking with this insurance now. (Unless I’m mistaken about how this all works) Its worth the monthly premium $ to not have days of anxiety or worry while waiting for a doc appointment. I was also able to call in at 10pm about a UTI and the prescription was sent over to my pharmacy in minutes. UTIs get worse by the hour and can be dangerous. This saved me from having to sit in a covid filled emergency room all night to solve that prob. So so so grateful! more"

        "review": "I feel Teladoc as a whole is great in theory reaching people for a multitude of health related issues. Unfortunately I had two unreliable physicians more than once and it can be difficult to switch once you have seen a specific doctor several times. No one wants to go through medical history again, and again. My physician forgot every time they filled my prescription that I could not have 3 months filled at once, this lead to me needing to request a refill from them every month! Finally the physician completely ignored my pharmacy requests leading me to make an appointment where they rescheduled me over 5 times, just to ultimately cancel with no follow dates (this is not the first time). Then the dermatology physician completely ignored everything I said and I had no resolution, waste of money! I’ve gone with out medicine for 3 weeks, I only needed a quick consult. I’d appreciate better and less struggling, maybe this means Teladoc is more transparent with their physicians resulting in better scheduling and communication to clients. It is very difficult to go on and off mental health medication. I’m willing to give Teladoc one last shot, after all maybe I’m unlucky with two unreliable physicians, but it is the last chance for me. If the results do not improve I will use other sources here on out. more Hi there, We are so sorry that you had this experience and would like to help.

        "review": "The app is beautifully designed and has fairly intuitive UI/UX, but there are just so many bugs. Tried to join the waiting room for my appointment this morning, only for the next screen to pop up for a split second, disappear, and a half cut-off yellow error message at the top of the screen to pop up. I did this probably 10-15 times trying to enter the room. I had two appointments booked in advance, and the second screen with my next appointment details had the date and add to calendar button completely overlapping on the same line. The app makes me go through the same intro screens every time I log in. Seemingly not a big deal, but super annoying to click through prompts about sharing health data, location, remembering password, etc. every single time. This info should be saved and not addressed every time. Similarly, having to fill out the mental health questionnaire each time you want to schedule an appointment with your provider is so frustrating. Maybe shorten it after the initial visit, just to check up on things that change often? It takes forever and is unnecessary to address before each (sometimes weekly) meeting. The animations between screens are nice, but move slow and get old when trying to move quickly. It tends to drag, and gives the app a slow and lagging feel. This is a small detail but it drives me nuts lol The services are great, but the app tends to hinder the experience. more Thank you for taking the time to let us know about App performance issues. If you have any more information to help our dev team make improvements, please send us an email at information@teladochealth.com with your name, phone number, and screenshot of this review along with more details.

I’ve been using this app for years and Clue has continued to update their app to improve function and usefulness for the masses. It not only tracks your period, but just about anything else health-related, too! It follows your moods, cravings, energy levels, exercise levels, weight, acne, you name it. If you mess up with following your period, you can even go to your analysis section and choose to omit a specific cycle from your overall period tracking; for example, I forgot to track my periods for a few months. When I came back, I simply hid that cycle from in history so it wouldn’t skew my future period predictions. Even from an educational standpoint, the app offers plentiful resources to gain access to information about contraception, love and sexuality, fertility, and even postpartum symptoms. You can use this app to do, literally, WHATEVER you need—it all depends on how much information you pour into it. The more data you enter, the more accurate and helpful the app will be for you. It also helps you be more attentive to what you’re feeling and how every internal and external factor is influencing all the different aspects of your personal health. I love how expansive and all-encompassing Clue is, and it has become a staple in my own health/self care journey. Thank you, Clue! more Hi, we really appreciate you taking the time to write such a positive and thoughtful review. Thank you for sharing what you find useful, it's really helpful to hear what does work for users of the app. I have shared this with the rest of the team, it will make their day!

I added in my past periods from another app and that helped a lot with it being able to always be spot on for my days. One thing I would recommend, is having a “Notes” section for days. I feel like that would be nice because I can remember why I didn’t take my BC (birth control) at a certain time and I can work on being more on time with it. It’d also be nice to keep track of other things in there, such as “my cramps were this bad today because xyz.” And instead of using just the cramps button, I can make a note of how bad or mild they were on which days so I can expect it for next time. I also feel as if it would be easier when talking to an OB/GYN about my periods because my cramps can sometimes be too horrible to the point I can’t even get up and out of bed (the top reason why I’m even taking it - and how irregular my cycle was before). A couple months ago I got the subscription to Clue, and it’s even better than I imagined! I enjoy getting the articles for what I feel on my period; certain emotions, why my cramps can be killer, etc. I’d definitely recommend this app to all my fellow friends. 💕 more"

        "review": "I like this app. I just started using it maybe 7 months ago, and even though I only had three pretty irregular periods, I was pleasantly surprised at how accurate the ovulation and period predictions were. It only took the first cycle for the next predictions to be shockingly accurate. It was very nice to have a discrete little banner warning me that my period was supposed to start soon. I love all the symptoms we can track, and the cycle analysis over time. Overall I would like to say I love the app. But I can't. Because I'm now pregnant, and there's no way for me to change my life stage to \"pregnancy\" from \"menstruating\" without signing up for Clue Plus. I understand and accept that Clue wants us to pay for the pregnancy information, but I don't understand why I can't even change my status (and effectively put my cycle on \"pause\") until I give birth. I feel disappointed that this excessively long \"cycle\" could skew the information they collected from the previous ones, making my predictions less accurate for a long time postpartum. I can't imagine how much more disappointing this would be if I had been using this app for longer. I also think it would help to add a \"postpartum\" or \"breastfeeding\" life stage, since you aren't pregnant anymore but those situations still effect if/when you menstruate. more Hello, thanks for leaving us this review. Our pregnancy tracking mode is a paid feature, but we do offer a 7-day free trial where you can test it out and see if you find the content and tracking useful (it comes with tons of guided content, painstakingly written and fact-checked by our science team, as well as a whole suite of pregnancy-specific tracking features). We also have a post-partum life stage you can choose. If you prefer not to join Clue Plus, you can also exclude a cycle in the analysis tab so your data isn’t skewed. Hope this helps!

        "review": "I will start by saying that I have been with my therapist and talkspace for years now but there are a number of issues: the biggest one being, insurance being out of network but there’s no notification of that. I just recently discovered that my insurance is OON and I had no idea until Talkspace requested payments and i checked my insurance portal. This is a HUGE deal when it comes to treatment. I, myself work in healthcare as a utilization reviewer that works to get prior authorizations so I know the urgency of ensuring not only are patients covered but that it’s communicated when they are not. When you’re doing messaging sessions weekly which are being billed for and you don’t know that they’re not covered then that only increases the need for therapy…. An alert notification in app would help to notify patients when their benefit information has changed or a phone call. Next, the glitches are pretty annoying. Having to restart the app essentially when it freezes and now with upgrading to a new phone it does not want to open with my FaceId then it just keeps trying to open itself and I have to swipe out of it, move my face away, and enter my passcode instead. I’ll have to see if I can turn off the FaceID to just use my passcode. I love my therapist and don’t intend to leave her but this insurance issue is a big issue for me. more Hi there, I am happy to hear that you love your provider and have been with Talkspace for years. I do apologize for any misunderstanding regarding your insurance and billing. I appreciate you taking the time to provide such valuable feedback as we continue to improve our user experience. more"

        "review": "I was initially matched with a therapist that specialized in a subject that I had no issues with nor did I specify I had issues with. I had to accept in order to try to change therapists, only one of which was female (which is what I wanted) so I had to accept that.. but I felt like I wished I had more choices to pick from. My therapist was nice. Very generic though, and didn’t know how to use the platform. Promised to email me something and never did. Red flags raised when she cancelled our second appointment together but we rescheduled in the same week. I really wanted routine and continuity… and I didn’t want to switch providers at this point after already going through a really tough first appointment. So I stuck with the same provider. Fast forward, she cancelled our 4th appointment, rescheduled it for two days later, then I waited on video and she never showed up and didn’t message til the next day with a pretty tepid sorry. I called (to no avail) and emailed Talkspace to share this and show my disappointment and yes I got a refund, but no apology for being treated as unimportant or uncared for. Talkspace was my therapist’s side gig so clearly not as important as her full time job which is fine if that’s ok with you. But it took its toll on me. Will not continue. To add insult to injury, the app is not very user friendly. more Hi there, thank you for taking the time to write this review. We are so sorry to hear that you had a frustrating experience with your therapist and the platform. Your feedback is immensely valuable as we continue to grow and learn as a company.

        "review": "Give me all of my money back. I don’t write app reviews, but there is no way to get any type of response from customer service. I was a brand new paying subscriber that needed assistance with a billing/technical issue. I’ve reached out via email multiple times for a week with no response, which is valuable time and money going down the drain as I wait on customer service to respond to what should be a simple request. After many automated emails, I went to social media dms to try to get ahold of someone. My question could easily have been taken care of with a quick phone call but they don’t offer any type of customer service phone call. This has created much more stress and frustration on me, all while my paid subscription dwindles down. I was now charged for TWO different subscriptions that Im not using. You’ve been unable to assist me in a simple request so PAY ME BACK….all of it. This “partial refund” automated refund wizard thing isn’t the right approach. I never used your services, only spent time trying to figure out how to get set up correctly! Take This Advice CS- If you don’t have enough customer service support to handle new clients, pause taking in new subscribers until you can fully serve them. Week long delays and keeping my money is not right. I’m done trying to make Talkspace work for me on my own. Bottom line - I’ve cancelled my account(s) and I expect Full Refunds now. more Hi there, thank you for taking the time to write this review.

I adore the growing hand and foot images as well, so precious and it just helps the whole experience of pregnancy feel more real. I also really appreciate the anonymous community feature as well! On my of biggest frustrations with other apps is questions being ignored/unseen because I wasn’t a “top member.” I do have two other apps as well but each only serve one purpose. If Ovia would include these, they’d be a one stop shop far superior to the others! I use Pregnancy+ solely for the 3D realistic baby. It just helps me feel connected to my baby to know and what he might be looking like each weak. The other is app I use is The Bump. Similarly to Pregnancy+ there’s a more realistic visual. I love that I can see the baby in relation to my own body. It’s highly informative and helps keep my anxiety at bay. I also notice that The Bumps size comparisons seem to be a bit more in line with what I’ve seen online, though I do SO LOVE that you can change the theme of the size comparison with Ovia. Overall, Ovia is the #1 app I would (and do) recommend to all my expecting friends and family. more"

        "review": "This app definitely has a ton of useful features and is great for tracking a LOT of things. However, I really wish it would let you put in your own medications to track and also not just suggest 3 medications you regularly input. For instance, I take probiotics daily and there isn’t even an option for that (which is a common supplement), plus I take other supplements not listed. Let me input my own to record please. I also take more than 3 things every day but it only shows me 3 options and then I have to manually search for everything else every single day. Meanwhile it suggests like 6 of the top medicines people take all the time, but I don’t take any of those so they just take up space where I would rather see MY top 6. I also wish I could add multiple meds or symptoms without being spit back out to the data page after every single one. Let me select everything and then hit done so I don’t have to keep coming back into the symptom or med tracker and hitting search over and over. There are other minor annoyances with the UI too, one being that it often glitches and shows me the data tab at the bottom of the calendar screen even though I selected the notes tab. And when you try to view the trends graphs, you can’t zoom out to view the whole graph; you can only see like 2 dots on it at a time. Just feels like the app could use an upgrade and a slight UI makeover. more Thank you so much for taking the time to reach out and provide these thorough suggestions!

        "review": "I’m nearly 18 weeks pregnant and have been using Ovia every day for months. When I first found out I was pregnant I installed five different pregnancy apps. Ovia quickly became my favorite because the health tracking is so flexible and intuitive. I’ve been tracking my sleep, weight, and symptoms, and ignore the parts I’m not interested in tracking (e.g. mood, nutrition, exercise). I also like that there’s a nice-length article each week and some daily content that isn’t too overwhelming. On the cons, sometimes the app takes a while to load, or to load the health tracking page. The daily questions of if I’m taking my prenatal vitamin got REALLY annoying really quickly, so now I just click “yes” on whatever question pops up when I first open the app to get past it quickly in the morning before I’ve forgotten my sleep hours. I think this has given the app some false data. My biggest qualm though is that I can’t seem to export my tracking data. I can’t believe this isn’t an option! The app only lets you graph a few variables over time (weight, sleep—though not your total sleep if you log multiple stints of sleep a night—activity, steps, blood pressure, and nutrition) and I am just itching to make my own graphs of some of my symptoms over time. The fact that it looks like I’m going to have to pull the data out manually is a HUGE bummer. I’m hoping this becomes part of the app in the near future. more"

Now, unless you do several Botox appointments in the year, only treating one area at a time, it’s next to impossible to maintain A-list status. The new program is designed to force people to use fillers to meet their point requirements when there’s lot of people who don’t want fillers. Oh and did I mention what their new top tier status called A-list gets you. NOTHING! No more bonus dollars, no more perks, all gone. Just non-expiring points, which I was just told is also a lie even though their terms and conditions say points don’t expire, I’ve been an A-lister for years and apparently my points expire. The app is crap as well, you can’t can’t see this new expiration detail, you can’t see if and when your A-list status was renewed or extended another year, there’s no customer service by email. Only phone # and a basic M-Fr 8-5hrs when EVERYONE else in the U.S. works and when you do reach someone they give you different answers, which is why I prefer email to provide proof of what was told to me. Just another money hungry company, finding ways to lose customers. Wonder how far they will take this crap of a program and app before they lose so many customers they bleed dry in money. more We're sorry to hear that you had a bad experience with Allē.

If the tooling for insurance plan lookup was a bit easier to manage on mobile this would be a perfect app. Thank you again! —previous review— I frequently use the MyQuest app and prefer my local Quest over any other lab draw place. I’ve seen this app go from being clunky to reliably responsive now, and there is less lag on loading results or flipping between screens (home, to MyQuest, etc). I especially love that the attached results in MyQuest now have reference links. The one caveat now is that those links do not give you the option to open them in the default, or chosen browser, on the device. Additionally, and this is more feedback for the way results are entered into the database, but any tests done at Quest for a provider that faxes, or sends via portal should be shown in the user’s results page. I think it seems assumed that the person may have access via a MyChart or other patient portal access account but it is nice, for consistency, to see all results from any provider in that page.

This time it was different I know I was a walk in but I needed to have my hemoglobin checked because if it was even lower I would have to go to the hospital and get a couple of pints of blood. I wanted all day that they were open to find out because of them being behind they where behind schedule Finally at 20 minutes to 3 one of the other nurses explained to me that they need that extra 20 minutes to finish paperwork to get blood samples out. That I understood but the nurse that was so rude and kept saying that they are not taking any walk ins. So she could have explained this and what they had to do then I wouldn’t have spent about 6 hours there. But I didn’t have to spend my entire day there without eating and just sips of water. I don’t know her name but she has red hair and freckles and fair skin, so I would like to know her name.

I like that I get my labs not just my doctors… so I’m not waiting to find out… I already know and can make my own suggestions. It is pretty user friendly. If there was anything I say needs improving, it would be a guide for those who have never used the app before to know what information goes where… as a healthcare professional some people need more assistance that others. It may seem self explanatory but when you go to the app you are not automatically logged in, and people set up appointments only to realize they were never logged in. But reassurance that it isn’t lost, they just need to log in is comforting. I help patients to navigate the app when they ask, but maybe there’s a way to incorporate a reminder to sign in before scheduling. Otherwise I like the app, been using it for several years, and I have various doctors so, it again is convenient and easy to access lab results once they are ready! more"

        "review": "I think they have thought of everything when developing this app. You can tell parents developed this and that they really considered every last bit of information new parents might want. Especially helpful is the fact that my husband and any other caretakers can also download the app and be on the same account. This way, while I'm at work I can see the baby's activities including when and how much she took her bottle, when diaper changes occurred and their condition, when she napped, and really anything else the caretaker wishes to log. It's really helpful in discovering patterns in baby's eating, sleep, and other behaviors. Also helpful when trying to remember when something last happened (say the doctor wants to know when the last dirty diaper was), you don't have to remember because you can look. One suggestion I would make is to add a feature for tracking and reminding mom's medications. Having had a c-section, aside from having to keep track of everything to do with baby, I also had to keep track of my own pain management meds. It would have been nice to just track them in the same app where I tracked baby. Perhaps it could be a feature you turn on in settings to use while needed and then turn off once it's no longer needed so it's not bogging down the main entry page once mom is healed. However, this critique isn't enough to lessen my love for this app- it would just be an amazing above-and-beyond feature. Thank you for this app! more"

Our son had jaundice and we needed to pay attention to what kind of diapers and when/how much he was feeding. Being so exhausted, it is easy to not pay attention to what time the baby ate last or was changed last. I remember at my last appointment I was trying to calculate how often the baby fed and how much etc. I'm ready for our 1 month appointment now. I can literally show his doctor how often he eats, is having wet/dirty diapers, and how much he is sleeping. I tried writing all this down on a log, but we kept forgetting to do it and was guesstimating times. At 4 am in the morning I can just press the plus sign and log how much and it records the time etc. I haven't played with too many features, but have noticed you can log activities like tummy time, the babies weight/ length. I love that there is a chart to see where he is on the charts with growth. I wish I had looked or found an app like this with my last baby. I also love that this app doesn't cater to just breastfed babies or formula fed, but both. This is also great for moms supplementing as they can log both very easy. It gives an option to log pumping sessions as well. You can also add notes with all of your logs. more"

It’s made all of his doctors appointments a breeze— I can tell them when his last weigh was and how much, exactly how many diapers a day, exactly how often he feeds and for how long. It helps me keep track of how long it’s been since my sense of time is off kilter at the moment. I’ll think it’s been an hour since I’ve pumped but it’s been three so it’s nice to have that- for all of logs, not just pumping. This app is incredibly customizable. You can add notes to every log, adjust everything about a log after it’s put in, and even make your own “milestones” which I use to track when I’ve given medication. If you’re pumping and supplementing, it keeps track of how much milk you have in reserve and you can edit this number manually in case of spills, etc. My only critique is that there is no good way to log collected milk, as in using wearable milk collectors throughout the day like my Boons. I’m currently logging that milk as part of the next pumping session but I don’t love that solution as it makes it look like I pump way more than I do. Another option would be to manually adjust my milk store but then that milk wouldn’t get counted in the day’s input statistics. more"

I had difficulty understanding how the whole thing worked there were no instructions on how to get to the therapist and how to handle technical issues on my IPhone. I found that I needed to remember to refresh my screen every five minutes or the picture would freeze. Or to turn off my notifications or the picture would freeze up or go black. Then you would have to hit the exit app button on the phone. Also, turn off your smart watch or the audio will go to it. Actually it’s better to just turn off your Bluetooth altogether for a video chat. I love the two therapists that I have. They’re very professional and were quick to make me feel comfortable. They asked smart questions and were attentive when I answered them. They gave me exercises that were easy to do and challenging. I think that 45min is not enough time for the first two sessions. I had so much trauma in the past that once I got started it was hard to stop talking in the 45 minutes allowed. I think a wider assortment of specialists is needed. This should be expanded once the kinks are worked out.

He actually broached that fact and the fact that I really need to see a specialist and what the consequences for me are short term and long term. My own PC will not talk to me about my condition. Fifth, he offered an alternative medication that has not been tried and I’m excited about using this med as a short-term treatment until I can see a specialist. Sixth, when he wished me well and hoped that I would feel better soon, it was authentic. He actually hopes that I will get relief and get back on my feet shortly. That was absolutely unique. I don’t know if every doctor in the service is as good as Dr. Lynn, but if they come close, they are better than the majority of doctors out there these days in my experience. more Thank you so much for your review!

I got a call every 30 minutes asking if I wanted to cancel my appointment- until about midnight. I thought they would call but finally fell asleep. I woke up about 6AM and checked the app for my wait time. It said 15 minute wait. After 20 minutes I checked again to see my wait time. It became a 30 minute wait time ... so I called customer and got through. (Something I had not been able to do since making an appointment) and there was a nice man named James who apologized profusely about 9 hour wait. He then recommended I schedule a time appointment (why couldn’t I do that in the first place) for 12:30 - which would be quicker than a next available. Oh my word! So I decided to do it anyway since I was still having symptoms even though I was feeling better. I got a call back 10 minutes later saying there was a mistake and the doctor couldn’t do it over a text gone call. Had to be video chat so now they were rescheduling until 4:30PM - you know, right about the time pharmacies are closing because of Corona. I decided to take it anyway. Finally feel better and just canceled. I completely understand that there are back ups due to Corona but my wait time was completely ridiculous and they did not handle this in a professional way. They are not reputable in my opinion. more Please accept our apology for your frustration. Requests for virtual health care have increased significantly due to the spread of COVID-19.

When simply reading about a topic, it’s hard to retain everything. There’s also a difference between understanding the material and knowing exactly how to put it into practice. This app help you learn the material AND grasp how to apply it in clinical settings. They already show lab results, but I haven’t seen imaging results, and that would be helpful. Other nice additions would be more questions about what the differential diagnosis is and what history questions and physical exam components you’d add. Basically, more questions would help me think even more critically through the process. Thanks for a fun, helpful app! more Hello J.K. Rob, Thank you for your wonderful and encouraging feedback. We really appreciate you taking the time out to share your experience with us. I've already forwarded your suggestion to our development team for their attention.

        "review": "It’s a great little Ap to catch a quick review, but be cautious as some of the treatments in the scenarios are not in line with current recommendations. For example, the scenario with cat scratch disease (Bartonella) recommended withholding antibiotics despite the patient having over a week of fever and lymphadenopathy. The scenario also recommended a lymph node biopsy with PCR testing to confirm the diagnosis despite a very clear history. The research on antibiotics vs no antibiotics is pretty clear and the expert consensus is that any patient with a clear history and lymphadenopathy be treated with azithromycin. The consensus is that lymph node biopsy should be reserved for cases that do not respond to appropriate antibiotics. UpToDate has a great review of cat scratch disease. more Hi soldierDoc2, we are glad you enjoyed the app. Thank you for sharing your recommendations re: the cat scratch disease scenario—I have passed them on to our editorial team. Please note: our editors keep updating our scenarios to be in line with the latest reviews and clinical guidelines.

The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital. If you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment. Keep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital. Thousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app. Always consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration. This app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app. If the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there.

I loved the ability to delete a contraction time after accidentally pressing the button. Thankfully, I was able to take naps between contractions and even with forgetting to press the stop contraction button it was able to still give me accurate readings. Unfortunately, I did not go to the hospital on the first alert, however, after many alerts to go to the hospital, I finally made my way to the hospital the next day. At 10 that morning, I went to get my cervix checked finding that I had a very high pain tolerance and was told that I was 7cm dilated. With this app, I was able to show the nurse when my contractions first started the following evening and all my contraction times I had up until I arrival. I was admitted into the labor room, went natural with no medication and had my daughter two hours later. Thank you for making an accurate and reliable app.💜 more"

On the day I went into the hospital, I was walking around target and curb walking in the plaza(to naturally induce labor) I tracked my contractions and it told me when I needed to start getting my things together (they were already in the car) and when to go to the hospital. I waited maybe another 45 minutes to be sure the alert was legit and continued counting. On the second go to the hospital alert I was On my way! Got to the hospital and delivered 9 hours later!

But I was not sure if it’s a true labor and didn’t want to end up in Emergency Room and being sent back home for false labor. So I kept tracking the timing of contraction but it was difficult to analyse. And during that time, I found this app in App Store, since it had high ratings and good reviews, I wanted to give a try. I started recording my contraction timings for 2 hours continuously. Initially it was prompting me to get ready for the hospital. And at a point of time, it prompted me to go to hospital multiple times. We trusted this app and rushed to the hospital, and voila! That was a true labor and I was 6cm dilated already :) Can’t thank this app enough when it was a critical time and when we were confused to make a decision! I highly recommend to use this app! more"

Not canceled, not rescheduled, just non existent. I called the number to speak with someone. They couldn’t find my appointment. After about 45 wasted minutes they said they would send a report of some sort and call me back. Of course, no call back. I wasn’t expecting it judging by how uninformed the person on the other end of the line was. I can tell when someone is just blowing me off to get off the phone. She literally hung up on me after saying she would call me back. I finally found a confirmation email and was able to get to the appointment through the email. When I opened it up to join the call, the app kept asking me to “share my location” my location settings were set to “share” but the app kept denying me access. So I closed the app and opened it again. Nothing. After about 15 minutes of verifying everything, I missed the appointment. I sent a message to the team saying I shouldn’t be charged the $35 for canceling since the app didn’t let me in and still haven’t heard back from them about either of these two issues.

It could be useful for other things but so much about the app seems off or unnecessary. The digital donor card would be great for me to show a history of BP readings. Unfortunately, it shows only the last three readings, and if you have it show the full history, the only information shown is the type of donation, date, and location (full history of BP, pulse, and hemoglobin IS available on the website). Consistency of information would be good here. The Blood Journey is interesting but would be more so with a little more information and if it were more up to date (right now doesn’t have the info from my donation of over 3 months ago). And although I figured out that the Blood Journey is showing the donations in reverse chronological order, why isn’t the full date (showing the year) displayed? Most other informational features are unnecessary once you’ve donated once or twice, and the badges are lame. I’m a Power Red donor so only need to use this three times a year, so instead of bogging down my phone I use it on my iPad. Only got it for the benefit of seeing the Blood Journey, and have been waiting to see some improvements but have yet to be rewarded. I may just forgo the little information I do get about the Blood Journey (only available through the app) and just go back to using RapidPass on the website. more"

I have shown up at the donation site to donate platelets a few times, only to be told that my previous count or yield was low and was told that I needed to re-schedule at a later date. I was given those numbers at that time, but I could have avoided wasting the donation sites time (and mine) if I could have checked myself beforehand.

On the plus side, enabled FaceID 🤩 and Notifications in Settings. Hoping Notifications includes badges. App menu icons would be nice. The pure text approach and lack of color too sterile. Icons would help. Nothing wrong with adding the app icon to top of screen or some other art. On iPhone 11 running iOS 14.2 more"

Doctors are allowed to falsely state themselves in search filters as taking public health insurance when they only take private. Despite this being reported multiple times, Doctolib claims it’s not their responsibility for wrong information being posted on their app/website despite being the only booking place for several doctors. They also allow doctors with shady qualifications. The offerings listed for appointments is always too small/too little and there seems to be no quality monitoring or proper reporting system, leading to some practioners trying to scam new patients (usually immigrants) while Doctolib looks the other way. Book through your health insurance instead, it will save you the time and drama more"

Wife could not take me per her physical condition, but called clinic to inform them I was coming, called me and said they would be ready. And they were. Because of Aurora ‘s Live Well system, all was known. And all was ready for me. A Jennifer Krause FNP-BC took care of me, in a most professional way. And thanks to my Live Well record, knew all meds. I was on, and what she could or couldn’t give me. My tetanus status was over 5 years old and I needed one. Thanks to Jennifer and a RN, can’t remember her name.

Every Aurora doctor I have seen comes flying into the office, sits down, asks me to tell them what’s going on, gives me room for one sentence, cuts in, diagnoses without any kind of exam or test, prescribes something, and sends me on my way. Every single visit with every single doctor. If they do end up wanting a sample or something then make sure you are on top of reaching out once the results are in. They won’t remember to go back and review the results. You will end up suffering for days waiting on them to finally get back to you. When they do, do not expect any kind of apology or sympathy. They are taught not to admit fault. You will be told, even if you have the results in front of you and can read them clear as day, that the results really didn’t show much but if you are still having symptoms the doctor will prescribe something. LIARS!!! I LOATHE liars!!! They will absolutely lie to you. I have caught their doctors in lies multiple times. The Aurora doctors are not to be trusted! Please switch to another system.

But then a few people on there didn’t agree with some of the stuff I was post nothing negative to them or disrespectful mostly just venting and they became disrespectful and some of my friends got their accounts banned. Well this month of my 23rd weeks iv gotten several DM from WeMoms about twice talking about banding my account for harassment disrespectful language etc.. when I DM them asking them which post or comment was reported, I got no response back only to open my app. A few days later I get back on and boom my account is banned saying I’ve broken guidelines. This didn’t just happen to me but some of the moms iv made friends with. In other words a mom or someone with a fake account can report at pictures of your child and WEMOMS will send you a banned warning for harassment, or being disrespectful it only takes moms to not like what you post report you and boom your account is banned. WEMOMS you need to make your app more secure when it comes to reporting people stuff. YALL need to look more into what people are reporting and give us a chance to fight the report over just banned our accounts. I’m upset my account was banned with such poor reason. Do better! more"

They will also attempt to reach out to my Doctor when it's time to refill a prescription that doesn't have any refills left. The pharmacist can not fill a prescription without a doctor's order. And sometimes they need us to call our doctors to order more refills. And if our doctors don't supply the order then they are not able to fill it. But Optum Rx pharmacy keeps up with the time a refill is needed so that we don't run out of our maintenance medications, and that's a good thing. Local pharmacies don't. Most times they don't notify you when your prescriptions are ready for pick up. At least my doesn't. I have to call them to see if they have received an order from my doctors and when it will be ready for pick up. And even if the drug is an antibiotic or server pain medication I don't receive a call or text message to let me know that my prescription is ready. But using the mail order pharmacy is not a good choice for any prescriptions less than 3 months or 90 days. And my doctors usually will add 2 refills. So there you have it.

It showed the order as ready to ship with a due date 3 months ago. The app showed all the meds and let me order the one I wanted, but I couldn’t sign on to it directly through the app. It kept telling me the name and password were not on file. It was the same one I used to sign on the the website with no problem. Luckily you could switch to the app from inside the website which is what I did. That link signed on just fine. As always OptumRx has the worst software, most buggy, next to useless stuff I’ve ever used, and I am no newbe to computers. Please, please put some effort into fixing your software so it is intuitive, user friendly, and consistent between platforms, please. I have no choice but to use your service so I am stuck with it and have to fiddle with it or call every time I try to place an order.

        "review": "Ever since iOS 12, the app has become unusable. I decided to wait 2-3 weeks after the system release, before writing this critical review; in fairness to the developer giving them time to fix the log-in issue. Apple gives developers ample time (usually about 6 months) with their beta program to fix any issues before the launch of a new operating system, so it’s pretty shameful if your app has major issues on release date. Considering this is an app that many people rely on for their health, it makes it all the more shameful. I have not been able to login to this app using the fingerprint scanner for weeks. It’s not a systemwide problem, as all my other apps with fingerprint security logins work fine. When the app works, it’s provides the pertinent information needed, however the user interface is not very intuitive, and sways away from most of Apple’s good practices design standards. It’s not accessible and does not take advantage of Apple’s system-wide text resizing, which is imperative for people with poor or low vision. We should expect more from a company which we choose to safeguard our health. I couldn’t help but notice recent extraordinary amount of 5-star, one-sentence, generic reviews. Appears very suspicious. It’s possible these reviews were written are by positive individuals with little to say, or maybe they are fake reviews paid for by the developer, however that would violate Apple’s rules. more We value your feedback and we are sorry to hear about your experience.

        "review": "I have enjoyed using nurse grid for the last 5 years! It has helped me to not miss a shift and make adjustments based on my employers schedule grid. I can just open up the app and adjust easily what is listed online. It also helps me keep track of the shifts I charge, precept, attend education, PTO, time off and of course payday. It’s a quick reference guide when called to ask if you can work extra! Nurse grid also helps me to know and manage MY work time versus FAMILY time. I love the color options and icons. I even use nurse grid as my Calendar versus my phone or wall calendar! If I could change one thing about nurse grid though it would be the option to be able to see at least two items on the actual day of each month instead of just one or tapping to see if there is any pertinent items scheduled for your shift. For example, if I’m charging and precepting on the same shift I would like to see “C” and “P” on the display calendar instead of clicking each date to view details. Thank you nurse grid! more Hi there! Thanks so much for your review and feedback, we truly appreciate it! We'll pass along your feedback regarding the information displayed on each day in the calendar view to our Product Team. They review and consider all user feedback as they plan and build updates to NurseGrid. If you have any other ideas or suggestions, or if we can answer any questions, please contact us at support@nursegrid.com! more"

        "review": "I think this is a good app but is definitely not great. It feels very aged to me. There are apps with more functionality and more features. I think this is used because it’s just a standard with nurses, everyone just hops in cuz it’s what’s popular. Not sure if that’s why there are few updates and far between. Simple is good which is a great part of this app but there aredefinitely ways that can make it more user friendly and keep up with the times. With this app being out 4 years. I’m just expecting more. As others have suggested a dark mode would be appreciated as well as the ability to have a widget on your Home Screen for quick and easy viewing. More colors, icons that pertain to other aspects of life. I would also like to maybe have days with multiple events have a split color to see that my day isn’t just full of one thing without having to click on the dots for everyday I have lots going on. Also, definitely need to be able to compare multiple colleagues. Fortunately for me, I have more than one friend/coworker so it would be great to be able to pair up my schedule with ALL of them . Good app but can be better. Other Apps are too advanced for it to not have these features . Developers-I feel like need to be a little more innovative with ideas and make it a priority to push out not only bug fixes but ALSO new features, maybe a slightly different upgraded interface. more Hi there! Thanks so much for taking the time to write out your thoughts. We truly appreciate your suggestions on how NurseGrid can be better. As you pointed out, many of these suggestions have also been made by other users, and have not gone unnoticed by our Product Team, who are working to implement them. We look forward to sharing our progress and updates with you in the future! more"

        "review": "Wow. This was he first time I’ve used plush care and it was a really good experience. Dr. Savery was right on time, professional friendly. She was kind and warm in our interaction and it really was just like a doctors visit in an office but I never had to get out of bed. I’m feeling terrible and the thought of having to get up, dressed drive and commit probably 2 or more hours out Was too daunting. She spent all the time needed with no rush. I called because I felt like I had a uti, which came on very quick. I’ve experienced this multiple times a year the last few years and I was discouraged to have to go through all the motions of physically seeing a doctor when I suspected I needed antibiotics, it’s been a 5 minute discussion in the past, prescription and done. So, she diagnosed me just the same as physically having to see a doctor. She gave me the precautions to look for if I were to get worse and needed a face to face visit. She called in my prescription, so, I can just make a quick trip to pick it up and I’ll be better. My insurance no longer covers my doctor I’ve seen for years and I don’t want to switch so, when I rarely need a doctor, I pay out of pocket anyway. So, it was only about $15 more than an in office visit. This service is amazing and I’m so glad I decided to try it. I’m so thankful for seeing dr. Savery today. more"

I was worried about having multiple doctors but the Doctors are awesome, compassionate, ask the right questions, in a short period of time, and never rushed. PlushCare keeps a log of your visits. Which is headache free to remember them all. I get frequent utis. Having to sit for hrs in an emergency room in pain. I no longer have to wait. Make an appt, be prepared to answer questions. Docs are earlier than appt and so far the Docs are better than an emergency visit. When you know you need antibiotics. The docs do send you to get a culture tests done. Pick a location close to you. So easy to get done, quickly. Lab techs are just as fantastic! I have had my culture lab test lost at an emergency room twice and your sitting not knowing for more hrs. They lost it. (Mind you. Your paying for it.)😞 I felt nervous seeing multiple Doctors but so far. 💯 stress free. Most of all affordable and do use your ins, too. If you have it. PlushCare is a Godsend. This is just a perfect way to see a doctor for minor medical issues without leaving your home. Easy to set up. Easy to change your pu location for meds, etc... So easy to use, bottom line. Thank you Dr Crabtree and Dr Riad 😊 Also I will mention the communication thru, video chat, emails and texts, is easy and not confusing at all. 👍👍👍 more"

        "review": "I found PlushCare while seeking answers to support both myself and my daughter who tested positive for the Omicron virus. Although I was fully vaccinated I developed a fever and a cold that progressed into the worst sore throat I have ever experienced in my life. I started getting really nervous as my throat was severely inflamed and I believe I developed throat ulcers. I had terrible coughing fits that burned terribly and I was concerned about my breathing going forward as I was struggling with swallowing. The constant nasal drip made things more difficult. This went on for two full days. Finally I was able to book a 7am appt with Dr Chansky after being up at 2pm, again. She knew right away what I was experiencing and prescribed Miracle Mouthwash and an anti inflammatory that my partner picked up just three hours later. Later, after approximately 25 hours of excruciating pain, my throat like opened up and almost all of my throat pain dissipated-I could swallow normally again! The Magic Mouthwash helped me sleep and eat in the interim. Ps-I eventually discovered that green tea w coconut oil and greasy lo mein noodles was a saving grace to put down food and medicine and stay hydrated. Thank you Dr. Chansky and thank you Plushcare!!! You saved me and kept me out of the very swamped hospital. more"

        "review": "As someone who has suffered from migraines for my entire life I was always trying to find an effective way to track them and record details. However, I kept having trouble remembering and keeping everything organized. I love this app because it’s so easy to enter the info, but it also has a good amount of detail. It compiles the data and presents it to you in an interesting way that can help you get a new perspective on symptoms, triggers, and your body’s patterns. I especially like the sleep tracking part (it’s linked to my FitBit, but it can also link to an Apple Watch), as that is one of my main triggers, and having definitive information about my sleep schedule can really help me predict and prevent migraines. The resources are helpful and the chat forum is a wonderful place to discuss your experiences with other migraine sufferers, as well as to get advice or tips on how to manage your migraines. My main issues with the app are mostly that there are occasionally typos, which can sometimes make it feel slightly less professional, and that the layout could probably be improved a little (it’s quite bland and sometimes things kinda blur together). If I were to suggest anything I would suggest the ability to make a more in-depth profile and the option to do private messaging. I believe it would be quite helpful to be able to have one-on-one conversations with people you might have met through the forum. more Thank you for your strong support!

A doctor told me I should be tracking them to better understand my triggers and my research led me to this app. I love the interface. It’s calming to look at when I do have a migraine. It feels like a friend who understands my pain, my triggers, and what helps. Being able to track them and see patterns is very useful. I do subscribe to the plus version but it’s totally worth it to me even though I feel it’s a bit pricey. I’ve been subscribed long enough I’ve seen them add updates and use user feedback to improve what the app offers so I feel like the developers listen and respond to us. I like the discussions with other users. I love that I’m helping contribute to research for migraines. The guides to understanding migraines were helpful because I didn’t know a lot and I learned so much through the app. The app helped me figure out what my triggers even are, and a few were surprising, and other users helped me figure out some options for relief.

One improvement they could make to the design is, they ask when you have and episode two press the button on the face and then log it either in a book or the Internet. I chose the Internet. The two problems I see are if you choose the book it’s too big to fit in your pocket. you may not have it with you when you need it because of that. The second problem is the unit itself. It may just be the unit I have, but it’s hard to tell when you press the button during an episode whether or not it actually worked meaning the switch the button is not as definitive on and off as it could be. My real thoughts are if this thing works and we can get my medication’s in wine I’ll be very very happy. Would I try it again? If the doctor requested it you bet it’s simple it’s easy! more"

It’s a cheap excuse of anything else available to a practicing clinician and barely suits a medical student. I would never pay a nickel for it to use, yet forced to use it since our institution chose the 4th rate option to save money. As a result, most of the attendings and housestaff across multiple services signed up independently to UTD, effectively wasting any potential economic savings with Dynamed. more Hi, we are sorry that you're having issues with DynaMed.

That meant, I had to pay full price for my medication. If I had to buy the medication without single care, it would have cost me more than what I earn every month. Single care absolutely saved my life. I could not have survived, without single care. The price of my medication was astronomical. I stopped taking 1/2 of the medication prescribed to me. Why? I could not afford them. It was terrible. Fortunately, I found a Single Care advertisement ,in the waiting rooms of one of my Dr’s. I had very low expectations when I signed up. I figured, this is a free service, there must be a catch!! Was I 100% wrong. The amount of money I save/saved using Single Care is incredible. I can’t thank Single Care enough for making it possible for me to get ALL my prescriptions! It’s free to join , I hope you give them a try.

I can't believe this program is free and anyone can use it! I tell everyone about it.

For some reason this past year I went through a few rough illnesses, one in particular that no one was able to accurately diagnose. I was in the worst pain I have ever been in and everyone kept telling me that it was nothing, or that they weren’t sure what was causing it. With nowhere left to turn I decided to downloaded this app put my symptoms in to try and find out something about what might be going on. The app makes it clear that this is not a true medical diagnosis and that you should always seek help from a doctor in person when you can, but even still it came up with a few possible diagnoses that I was curious about. Nearly a week later, when my condition finally got bad enough a doctor was able to figure out what was causing the pain and it turned out to be the same diagnosis this app suggested as the most likely cause of my symptoms. Since this incident I have used the app a few more times and it has been very helpful and incredibly informative. more"

However, I believe that ada could be improved if we were able to add pre existing conditions to our profiles, in addition to our prescriptions actually factoring into the reports. Am I feeling fatigued because of my meds? Or is it something else? Pre existing conditions and medications can make it that much harder to question if it’s more than a side effect. And especially in the times of Covid seeking medical help is just getting more expensive in the US. But ada has helped me see when I should and shouldn’t go to the doctor (they helped me recognize the symptoms of pneumonia in time for me to get diagnosed before my lungs would be damaged any further than they were). I love this program, I just wish we could add the illnesses we already have and the effects our meds have on us. Of course the devs can’t list every medication, but letting us list the symptoms those meds cause should be factored into ada’s reports. There’s more conditions other than smoking, diabetes, etc that ada currently lists, and I feel the preexisting conditions are very limited. And I hope my thoughts on this are seen by the devs and can be brought into consideration. more"

        "review": "Originally, I had booked an appointment with a different virtual clinic early in the morning when they sent my link to connect finally after waiting a couple of hours they gave me 30 seconds to connect which it took me about 33 seconds to actually hit the button because I wasn’t feeling well first of all need less to say they canceled my appointment.. so of course I tried to book another appointment with same clinic of course an hour and a half later they sent me the link to connect with the doctor. I literally held my fingers on my keypad just waiting on the link, but I guess I was slow at responding within 15 seconds, and again it was canceled shame on me, but I should have went to another virtual clinic at that time but when we’re sick, we do weird things so I book with them again needless to say finally at 9 o’clock on the day that I booked the same appointment with a clinic it took me all of 20 minutes to fill out everything I needed to fill out and be seen by my doctor and get diagnosed and get my prescriptions!! I will definitely be using Amwell from this day forward!! They definitely get five stars If I could give more, I would would definitely recommend this company!! Thanks am Amwell!! more"

        "review": "OMG!!! I was super hesitant to try this service but didn’t feel like sitting in Urgent Care for hours for my particular issue. The intake process was surprisingly super fast! And the app is very user friendly. Once I completed my medical history and input my insurance information, I spoke with the doctor in less than 5 minutes! And this was around 2:30! Mid-day!!! When it’s usually impossible to get in and out of an urgent care facility. the whole process took less than 30 minutes! I promise, I do not write reviews, don’t have time, but I had to take a few moments to write this review b/c I was thoroughly impressed! The actual doctor, Dr. Cynthia Horner was AWESOME! She was patient with my explanation for calling in today, I did not feel rushed AT ALL, which sometimes happens in urgent care offices, she was on top of all of my questions and I felt very comfortable with her diagnoses. She even offered some encouragement around my fitness goals! I am so impressed and will definitely tell all of my friends about this experience! Thank you sooo much! more"

        "review": "The application itself is very glitchy and buggy. There were multiple times the app crashed during setup. Once I did complete setup and attempted to connect with a provider online, I was told the provider I selected would contact me promptly. 15 minutes later there was no call and no record of the pending appointment anywhere on my account. There was no way to contact anyone or receive any kind of update. I attempted to set up another appointment in fear that I hadn’t properly set the original appointed - went through the entire process only to be told that my initial appointment was still pending, and I could not set up another appointment until the initial appointment completed. Another 15 minutes go by, and I finally get a call from a physician that was not the physician I selected. He then proceeded to tell me that he wasn’t authorized to prescribe antiviral treatments for Covid 19 because I was not high risk, even though that is not in alignment with the CDC’s most recent messaging. All in all, I spent hours and $80 to get told inaccurate information from a physician that was not the one I selected. While the $80 is the max you will pay, the app was unable to confirm my insurance carrier, so made me pay the full amount in full before I could see a physician. All in all - very poor experience and I will not use this app again. more Thank you for taking the time to let us know. This is important feedback and I will share this with the team. more"

        "review": "After working in my yard (weeding with gloves), noticed a row of itchy- but tender- bumps along my wrist, some very tiny and one “main” one; they became red with a sort of salmon cast after a few days and didn’t resolve. At first, was reminded of a spider bite I got as a kid, with several satellite small bumps. They aren’t intensely itch but are pretty tender if I try to scratch. After about 4 days, i stopped wearing my watch to see if that affected it (nope). After a week or so, I applied topical steroid cream once, yesterday. These seems to be a little blistery looking. No new ones appeared. SO DECIDED TO CHECK THIS APP- it came up with several options, the top 3 of which are my top 3 diagnoses: insect bite/ atopic dermatitis/poison ivy. I’m sticking to insect bite since there is tenderness >> itching and no new lesions or spread since the first 24 hours. Putting watch on R wrist hasnt led to new irritation. I like the app for reassuring me that I wasn't likely missing anything! It Might be helpful to collect a little more history such as contact with allergen or outdoor or gardening exposure vs no outdoor exposure. more"

I mean a lot of work went into it but like someone else said, it just gives you an encyclopedic list of ideas of what rash, bite, bruise, etc might be. And there are NO realistic pics to compare yours with. I mean, I had a mosquito bite which I uploaded just to see how good the app was and it gave me back a pic of a crusted purple sore and asked me if mine was like it. The pics they show you in all the suggested options they compare yours to look nothing like your own pic you’ve uploaded. You are better off googling what you think yours is and then clicking on ‘Google image’ - you’ll get a hundred images and easily find one that looks like yours which you can then click on and read about. more"

        "review": "I’ve been using Bearable for about a month (after trying out some other trackers). I felt compelled to leave a review as I typically fall off the wagon with these kinds of things, but I’m consistently using this app after a month. I I can’t speak to what Bearable does or doesn’t do in comparison with others, because I never made it past the initial steps with the other apps and got frustrated with too many options and the general inflexibility (made me feel like I had to figure out exactly what I wanted to track right then and there when life just isn’t like that). Bearable has a ton of ways to customize that can seem overwhelming, but you can also initially hide those categories and track the most important stuff first and add in other factors and symptoms as time goes on. I really like that it integrates with apple health and I really love that the developer is very open to feedback and sharing about features that are in the works. Integration with Fitbit would be great, but for now syncing my Fitbit info to apple health with FitSync is working absolutely fine. Bearable automatically grabs the info. The trial period was SO helpful. Other apps have trial periods as well, but I cancelled them only days in after I’d had enough. I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop but it’s yet to happen with this. Highly recommended. more"

I had struggled with severe major depression, generalized anxiety, PTSD, and OCD (and still do, to a lesser extent) for close to a decade. I decided to invest in Bearable because anxiety had begun leaving me completely unable to function every single day — like literally spent a week in bed just incessantly panicking. Cue setting up Bearable, painstakingly inputting every detail I could think of. I found after several months of use that many of the things that I thought were “right” were actually leaving me in absolute wreckage, while my partner and his family were consistently bring my mood up SUBSTANTIALLY. Seeing the numbers laid out encouraged me to make the difficult decision of leaving what I now identify was a cult. It helped me cut ties with abusive situations that had trapped my family for generations. It helped me learn what joy was after years of hospital visits, SH episodes, panic attacks, and starvation. I am now living my best life and will look to Bearable again occasionally for answers to menial health concerns. This app changed my life and I would almost definitely not be here without it. more"

I also have chronic migraines from a severe head injury. Because of my autism, it's been difficult to communicate how I'm doing to my therapists and psychiatrists and doctors, and often I was not believed about the severity of my symptoms, or accused of not taking my medication, or told that my sleep or energy is better than I think it is. Now I have EMPIRICAL DATA all gathered in one place that provides an accurate assessment of my moods, symptoms both mental and physical, everything all in one place. My only complaint is that I wish you could time stamp EVERYTHING, not just medication times and mood and energy but also factors and symptoms instead of being limited to 4 time ranges because I'd like to see if a short-term intervention works and right now I can only see that I listen to relaxing music when I get anxious, but not whether I feel less anxious after listening to relaxing music.

It also explains the best way to take them, will let you know if there’s a recall even before it goes really public, and you can set the App up to notify you to take your medication. It will also check the Rx against your allergy list. Just recently , the app notified me that a new beta blocker I was prescribed had a major interaction with one of my chemos. It took my oncologist a week to find the source of that information in a tiny little article in JAMA, and it was absolutely correct. Things could have gone very south without that information and it was not in any of the Rx literature. This App also provides vital medical information when you or anyone else needs to know what you take in an emergency. You can also print out all the information either as a full sheet or as wallet cards to keep with you.

I even have to split my vitamins up and take them at a different time because they’ll interfere with meds.

Since then, problem solved. I needed more potassium because of muscle cramps thanks to ehlers danslos so I ordered some but added it on here and saw the LIFE THREATENING affect they’d have on my because of heart issues I had and basically told me DONT TAKE TAKE THEM. So I cancelled them right away. Over all this app is awesome and wonderful!! No doctor or pharmacist can do what this app can because they can’t keep all this information in their head.

        "review": "This app has a lot of promise based on the UI but way too many issues. 1) For some reason you can’t edit the actual initial setup of a goal afterward (like the icon or color, or scale). Yes you can adjust the goal metrics but what if I want to change how it’s configured? 2) There are two seemingly “default” goals (mood and energy). I didn’t see how to delete them, but rather “hide them”. Hiding them made them disappear into somewhere I wouldn’t know where to look if I wanted them shown again. 3) Metric scale doesn’t have ability to count 0 (therefore making something like counting number of drinks, with 0 being the goal, impossible. 4) Even the feedback form in the app seems faulty. Tried to use it but every time I tried to press return for a new bullet the form disappeared. Unsure if it was submitting or just closing out. 5) The graphs are a good start but I’d like to see a daily chart as well, not just weekly or monthly. For a paid app this just falls way short. Canceled my trial. more Hi Ctelle1234 - thank you for your feedback, we really appreciate your thorough review of our app. We're constantly updating our service to ensure the experience our users are getting is always evolving and improving.

I went through the regular cardiac tests..... stress test, blood work, EKG, echo, and 48 hour mobile heart monitoring. The palpitations and rapid heart rate did not surface during these test. How discouraging, because my symptoms were real but not solid proof. My cardiologist was concerned but not convinced there could be a problem. I mean after all doctors work with concrete facts. I remembered I had a Kardia, AliveCor Mobile EKG which I had purchased a year or so before these symptoms to help with my mother's heart tracking. I started monitoring my palpitations with the view to sharing the results with my doc. I also used the device when I started to have longer rapid heart rate episodes which were sporadic and usually occurred when the Doc's office was closed. (Who can run to the doctor at a moments notice and get in? Not me) Bingo! Proof that my symptoms were real. I printed out the EKG records I had taken with my Kardia, faxed them to my cardiologist, and received a call the same day with the diagnosis of Afib. I truly believe a correct diagnosis came about faster, without a possible emergency room visit, and in the comfort/safely at home only because of this fabulous device and easy to use app. For under a hundred dollars it's the BEST investment in my and my family's health I have made. more"

        "review": "I have had atrial fibrillation for a number of years. During that time if I felt anything “off” I went to the ER. After relaxing and working with meditation all the symptoms went away every time. The doctors seemed to be as surprised as I was. There were many false alarms. At the hospital I was routinely checked-out. With 20 minutes of meditation all the systems were normal. My cardiologist was pleased with how I was being proactive. He showed me the Kardia app and I purchased it that day. The app gave me such peace of mind. I could use it to determine if I was having a heart event and needed to relax and check again to determine if I needed to go to the ER. Now, which is two years later, I have done routine daily readings and I’ve had no sign of a-fib except two times. I sent the results for an immediate reading and feedback. 20 minutes later—but using meditation and quietly coping whatever was going wrong had already resolved any concerns before my results even had been reported back to me. I keep my yearly check-ups and I’m doing great. Given my experience I recommend the Kardia app. It’s a great tool in your fight with heart disease. It’s peace of mind and no false alarm trips to the ER. It’s a huge piece of what I do to stay well and deal with my heart irregularities in a very wise way. Best of luck to anyone reading this post. more"

Treatment of A-fib is vital in preventing strokes, death, and disability. I was able to determine my skipped beats were not PVC’s from coffee consumption but PJC’s and probable culprit taking more levothyroxine than my thyroid levels warrant (plus my old pal, caffeine). Got my thyroid levels checked and Bingo! The intrinsic interpretation function will not give you that kind of diagnosis (only gives normal or not, a-fib or not options) unless you pay for an expert interpretation ($19) or get Premium package. If you can read ECG’s already, then this can help identify PSVT vs rapid A-fib, and many other dysrhythmias. No substitute for going to your provider, but the ability to share your rhythm strip is REALLY INVALUABLE. Option to carry it on your phone is brilliant because folks always have phones on their person to capture evrnts. I have added it to my first aid kit. Home health agencies should be using these and anyone doing wellness checks on older adults. I wonder how many lives this tool has saved, and how many strokes it has prevented? Amazing!

I love this app because I don’t have to find a sitter or load up my children in the car to take them to sit in a waiting room. The funny thing is...I started using Maven as part of a paid focus group, and now I love it and will be using it often. The medical professionals are great. They really listen to you and offer practical advice. Being at home is very comfortable, and I feel safer discussing sensitive things like my sex drive or weight. Some medical professionals can even write you a prescription. The prices are great in my opinion. More often than not you pay less than a copay to get straight to the point with your medical questions. No filling out extensive paperwork. No germy waiting areas. No consulting forums with people who aren’t qualified to give you medical advice. Even sessions with specialized doctors aren’t too much more than an average copay. The app is attractive and very easy to use. Make sure you fill in your health binder, and writer a brief pre-appointment note to help your doctor, therapist, or nurse practitioner know what you need. more"

The app itself is really pleasant to use. I also appreciate the access to experts. I've been able to connect with a dietician and PT when I've had questions, as well as a care navigator who helped me understand how to use the app. The PT was really appreciated - there was a 3-4 week waitlist to get into a pelvic health therapist locally, but I was able to schedule with a MavenPT for the next day. I’ve also benefited greatly from the lactation support (thanks, Susie!!) since the baby came. We have access through my husband’s employer, and I’d encourage all employers to offer it. Not only did it improve our pregnancy experience, we saved so much time from not having to travel to/from appointments (I.e., we took less time away from our jobs), and we saved healthcare costs by not having to see specialists in person. more"

I’ve been able to get same-day video appointments and texts from exceptional practitioners. For example, I got a 7pm same-day appointment with a world class reproductive endocrinologist when I needed fertility advice after a miscarriage. When I had sharp sciatic pain, I got an appointment in less than an hour with a physical therapist who showed me exercises over video chat while I was in bed in my pajamas. When I have quick questions about what meds to take while pregnant or whether it’s ok to eat certain things, I message an OB and usually get a response in under 30 minutes. It’s so much better than going through my normal healthcare provider, where it takes weeks to get an appointment and every checkup is so transactional. Maven is quick, easy, and has great doctors.

When a friend suggested this app, I thought, “Why have I never considered trying to manage them through technology?!” And I am so amazed! Just Wow! It’s changed my life so much!! I literally have to take medicine every two hours, so getting an alert instead of having to watch the clock is such a game changer for me! Also, no more guessing whether I took a medicine or not … and what time I actually took it (which is important for timing out my meds because I can’t take certain meds too close together). I can look back and say, “oh yeah, I was late taking this med by 30 minutes, so let me reschedule this next med for 30 minutes later. Oh, and that throws off the schedule for these others, so let me “easily” reschedule those as well.” Entering all my meds into the app was so easy and being able to enter the Rx number, amount of pills left, and set notifications for when to refill … guys, I just can’t say enough. It’s one of the simplest apps on my phone, but one that has had the greatest impact on my life. Thank you (to the developers) for making such a great, well thought out, powerful but simple to use app. It’s simplicity to use is what makes it so great.

I tried to open it five times and the same thing happens.

Seems like more meds keep getting added to my care every other day. My doctor called me this afternoon with a new med based on some lab work. No mention to interactions with my current meds. My husband picks up the meds from the pharmacy, no mention by the pharmacist of any interactions. Load the new med into the app and check for interactions and critical alert and red is what I see. Immediately call the pharmacist and not only could I not take the med at the time I was planning, I can’t take it with 2 of my other critical meds. If it wasn’t for this app I don’t know if I would have found this interaction on my own but my doctors and pharmacist most certainly should have.

With MyChart you will get your answer or results with the first correspondence. It’s secure and so easy to use. You get a text notification whenever anything new pops up so it’s hard to miss a result or response from the provider. If you rely on the phone remember that if the medical staff calls you and you don’t answer you go to the end of a very big line. It can take 2-3 days before you make it back to the front of the line. MyChart allows you practically instant access to your results. It’s a godsend for both the patients and medical staff. I highly recommend it if you want an efficient way to communicate with your provider. more Thank you for your review! We are glad to hear MyChart is working well for you. more"

        "review": "02 Jul 2023 I have been using the MyChart app from Epic for over 10 years and it has been great at providing the information I need in the spectrum of health services that I am provided with. There are a few things that the app / providers need to perfect MyChart however for it to be up in the five star range. 1. You need to enable the saving of all records regardless of type by the patient user as a PDF file. Having to take scrolling screen shots and save them so they can be opened into an image to PDF converter is a real pain. Safari already allows PDF saving of browser windows, MyChart needs to do the same. 2. Lab results, Practitioner Summaries and Notes, Radiology reports, surgery procedure notes and summaries need the ability for the patient to email them to primary and other secondary providers without having to go through the hoops in Item 1 and then emailing them. 20 Jul 2023: Received reply from Epic. I have used the Web site instead for Item 1; but, it will be more convenient from the app. Will update when that happens. The emailing is an isdue however that currently is only addressed by downloading a PDF the uploading on other providers portals rather than directly from MyChart. I find myself constantly having to do this because providers do not update secondary providers and visa versa. I feel like a mouse on an exercise wheel having go do the work that providers should be doing. more We are always looking to improve the experience for our users, and really appreciate the feedback. Printing is available from the website version of MyChart and will be added to the mobile app in a future release, along with the ability to save documents from the app as PDFs. If there is anything else we can look into, please contact us at MyChartSupport@epic.com. more"

You CAN change body maps. It will erase all data from previous but this more segmented map is what should appear in the app when you open it. It is MORE appealing with more options to choose your pain location and many people will not figure this out. You should change that quickly. So when one opens the app they see what they have indeed purchased and not something else, initially getting bummmed that it’s not what the purchased page showed and much later finding out it was there as an option.

        "review": "The Spruce product and engineering teams deserve some recognition—3 weeks ago, I submitted a feature request through the feedback link in the app, and within a few short weeks they had implemented it! Maybe they were already working on it, but what a coincidence! Check out the new privacy screen they added in v4.4.4. When you switch apps and Spruce is put in the background, instead of continuing to show your private conversation, now the app content is covered with a full screen app logo. You won’t see it in action until you switch back to the Spruce app, which will then fade out the privacy screen and show the normal app content. Thank you again Spruce engineering and product teams for prioritizing user privacy and for making the privacy screen behavior so natural that I think most people will just be happier and feel safer, without consciously knowing why. For me, what a treat it is to experience firsthand the generous responsiveness and skillful implementation of the engineers. Way to go!

Having a secure phone “line” that uses my existing phone is wonderful. I can tag clients so I can do searches for people with similar issues and email them information that might be relevant to them. I can “page“ myself to remind me to do a client related task or follow up with them. (It’s kind of like the marking.) I can get off of the phone with a client and immediately write a note to document the call. I can do video sessions. I’m looking forward to improvements such as clients being able to access from their PC (right now they have to use a smart phone) and better reporting so that I can more easily send out the client records when requested. But they’re a great service for a great price. My anxiety level has literally gone down because of the seamlessness of this service. Thank you Spruce! more Thank you for taking the time to share your experience on Spruce — we appreciate it and are glad to hear that you are using many of Spruce’s features to their full potential in your practice.

I had taken my night time medications which included my Diovan for high blood pressure, as well as the medication Prozocin which was prescribed for PTSD and was never told by any of my physicians that this was originally prescribed for high blood pressure. I went to my doctor for a treatment and I was so lethargic that the on call doctor thought I had overdosed because my blood pressure was so low 48/20 and he told the nurse to give me Narcan which made me very very sick. They were told that I hadn’t taken anything besides my blood pressure pill and the 3 Prozocin for my PTSD. And they never mentioned that I had literally taken too much medication to combat high blood pressure between the two medications. I came home from the hospital and went to WebMD and found answers about all of my medications and I had three other medications that were not supposed to be used together and made an appointment to discuss this with my physician and my medications were changed. After this close call I always use WebMd to check out any mew prescription that I am given before I ever get it filled. Thank you WEBMD FOR SAVING MY LIFE! Rhonda Moffatt more"

If I do a search in Conditions, I have to completely close and reopen the app, as no Back button appears. Otherwise, it is terrific! Yet another update to my initial review. I still have to close the app to get out of a major category, such as Conditions or Search. Now, in addition, if I am in Conditions, the A-Z list will not come up at all, even though it says it’s displaying. This means I can only access the Popular Searches. I’m out of luck if I need to look up something rare. I hope these will be fixed soon. Further update: Despite more updates to the app, all of the annoying bugs already mentioned are still there. I still have to close the app in order to go to another section (e.g., from Conditions to Drugs). I still can’t bring up the A-Z list of Conditions, or the A-Z list of Drugs; it’s only the Most Popular for both. No scrolling to a rare condition, or to a drug that isn’t on the top 94. May not be deliberate discrimination, but is frustrating nonetheless. Please fix! more"

        "review": "I was up in the middle of the night worried about a possible medical issue developing. I was doing all kinds of online searches but wasn’t satisfied with what I was finding. I then searched for “online chat with doctor” and found this app. I was extremely skeptical and figured I would have to pay once installed and I wasn’t prepared to do that as I didn’t know whether this was a legitimate app/service. However, it said I could chat for free immediately. I went ahead and entered my information and question and for some reason, I was lucky enough to be first in line. Dr. Mary Jensen was so helpful. She immediately told me what I could do to address this concern at home (it was the type of issue that genuinely could be dealt with at home, at least initially, and then if that doesn’t work, I suppose I will go in to visit a doctor and get prescription medicine, if required). I can’t tell you how happy and relieved I am. I had that type of anxiety which is acutely heightened at night and I am so grateful to have been able to address this concern immediately. I actually think this app is worth paying for now, (but the beauty of it is that there is also some service provided for free) and if you are parents of little ones, like I am, it could be really useful, in particular. more"

        "review": "This app was a very quick and efficient way to take care of my medical anxieties. I had a recent scare with a possible Tetanus infection. There was not a lot of answers I could find online for my specific case, so I went to look for a real chatroom, and happened on this app. The prices are a bit steep for average app fees, but definitely not as steep as going to urgent care in the USA. Additionally, it took not even 20 minutes to chat with a real doctor instead of possibly being put on hold for hours on end with other 24 hour services. With quick, efficient, and good advice, the session was over with what to look for and what to keep doing. Additionally, theres a free 3 day trial to make sure that this service is right for you. A perfect amount of time to get quick service when you need for a first time. They also have different plans for perhaps more chronic issues or, like me, getting service for a once in a while medical inquiry. Additionally, the app features other handy tools such as a way to track vaccinations as well as view past chats. I haven’t explored to many of the features deeply, but it’s nice to see a logging feature on a medical app like this. Obviously not a replacement for the ER, but a great app to turn to for more urgent and primary care type questions, especially with Covid19 making going to the doctor less of a chore and more of a gamble. more"

        "review": "This app is a scam. I used this app based on some fake reviews I read here in the App Store and online and the fact that I have used a real online doctor app before. Now, as for the SCAM? First…You’ll notice when you speak to a “doctor” that they literally just give you a copy and paste of what your problems could be from WebMD’s website. After that, they’ll say they’ll give you a prescription for your needs. Mine happened to be $19. They asked for which pharmacy I’d like to receive my meds at, and proof (picture) of my ID. Then, they’ll send a link (this link will have no actual proof of anything just a link for standard payment) once paid, I didn’t receive any follow up about my meds. I waited 24hrs and went to cvs to get it and nothing was there. I contacted a doctor via the app again, and they said I should receive an email when it’s been sent to the pharmacy. After 3 days of back and fourth with CVS (mind you, the free trial is 3 days) it was confirmed that no prescription was sent. Nor was one on the way. They also confirmed that doctors nor hospitals can verify when you’re prescription is ready for pick up. Only the actual pharmacy can do that. In short? Save your time, headache, and overall money. I’d give zero stars if I could. more Hello. Sorry to hear your experience was not to our standard. To prevent this from happening again, we hired a team of pharmacists that get in touch with the pharmacy on your behalf to ensure the prescription has been delivered. Our team processes all prescriptions within 24 hours, and you are entitled to a full refund if our team is unable to send your prescription to your pharmacy within the given time frame. I am hoping that by now, you have received a full refund for the experience you had with us in the past but in case you haven't, kindly contact support@yourdoctors.online. We apologize for not being able to provide you with the best service, but your feedback helped us improve. We hope that you would be able to give our application another chance to see the difference your feedback has made. Thank you. more"
