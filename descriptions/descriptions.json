A national faculty has compiled a summary of expert knowledge to help diagnose athletic injuries (history, physical examination, and imaging), determine the ability of athletes to play their sport, recommend treatment in the training room and beyond, and estimate return to play time. This information is presented in a highly structured and searchable format that allows quick access to key points to consider when making an informed medical decision. The knowledge in this App is meant to serve as a guideline, especially since this field is still largely an \"ART\": it is more expert opinion than high-level evidence-based studies. As an \"ART\" there are few absolutes, particularly regarding return to play, so one must weigh the risk-benefit for the athlete at a given level of competition with medical providers. This App is meant to serve as a helpful guide and reference to aid the medical provider into an individualized discussion of the risks and benefits of treatment and returning to the field in game time and in the training room. The information in this educational App is provided for general medical education purposes only and is not meant to substitute for the independent medical judgment of a physician relative to the diagnostic and treatment options of a specific patient's medical condition. In no event will The Cleveland Clinic Foundation be liable for any decision made or action taken in reliance upon the information provided in this App. Compatible with iPhone and iPad. more",

Using a combination of multiple test algorithms, we developed the test, which consider a wide range of factors and is able to recognize smaller nuances than any other risk calculator. After completing a brief questionnaire with pictures, you would learn whether you have any suspicious pigment mark on your skin or whether there is a potential risk of melanoma. This user-friendly application excels in its simplicity of use and is a great aid in preventing this disease. About 30-50 % of melanomas develop from a pigment mark. Melanoma is a malignant tumour of melanocytes which mostly develops on the skin. It is one of the less frequent types of skin cancer, but causes the highest number of deaths from these tumour diseases. In most cases, the health symptoms are initial transformation of a static pigment mark, the early removal of which often prevents development of a malignant tumour. Get a test of your risk of developing melanoma thanks to this mobile application, since prevention is one of the most effective weapons against this disease. There is nothing simpler than to get examined by a dermatologist in case of any suspicion, rule out the risk of cancer, and be sure you are healthy. Take advantage of modern trends in medicine and test yourself. The Melanoma Test application offers the following: \u25cf Melanoma development risk test \u25cf Disease information \u25cf Option to send test results via e-mail \u25cf Next test date reminder \u25cf Tips and tricks to reduce the risk of the disease \u25cf Sharing option more",

It is the best-in-class, has over 5000 5* ratings, is super simple and safe to use. Supports Apple Airpods and Bluetooth Headphones. \"It took some time and patience... thank you for creating this cheap, awesome technology to use at home.\" - Niki Category #1 in the USA and 102 other countries. Here's why... Developed by parents like you (with expertise in sound engineering and apps) who wanted a trustworthy way to record our baby's fetal sounds (kicks, heart beat etc.) - and keep a record of a quality that we hadn't been able to find before in other apps. Extensively tested on expectant mothers with over 450,000 downloads since launch! \"I was skeptical at first. Great app! Worth it.\" - Legretta **** But honestly, does it actually work?? **** Yes. We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the baby's heart beat, sounds (kicks, heartbeat and more) and using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear. NOTE: It takes time, technique and patience and depends on the position and number of weeks of your baby so you'll need to stick with it. When you do, our results are excellent. Results are best between 27-40 weeks as your baby is bigger and stronger. We constantly improve our extensive tutorial and techniques to handhold you through - we even have a support group on Facebook to help. We want you to be happy with Hear My Baby heartbeat and to monitor results can sometimes be difficult. If you are struggling (can't find your own heartbeat etc.) DO contact us via support. We want to help you! GIFT THIS APP: Click the \u201cBuy App\u201d arrow on the iTunes\u00ae App Store FAQs **** No Accessories Required **** We use the internal microphone from your phone to attempt to listen and record your fetal sound. We recommend Bluetooth Headphones for best results. **** How It Works **** 1. Hear My Baby, has been precisely engineered to listen to abdominal sounds, then record and amplify them. Listen to your own heartbeat first to confirm the app is set up correctly. 2. It works best when baby is head down and their back is facing forwards. 3. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room and focus on your lower abdomen. Listen then Tap record. 4. Our simple recording management helps you to keep a record of your special moment 5. Take a selfie if you wish and share 6. We'll walk you through exactly how to get the best baby heartbeat results. **** Easy Share Feature **** Sharing is awesome you can opt to share via Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram or email. **** We Care About Your Privacy **** We take your privacy and special moment seriously. You decide who sees or hears it and can delete it at any time. **** Before you start... **** You DO need to carefully follow the instructions for Hear My Baby to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super sensitive. HMB doesn't fake the baby heartbeat or other fetal sounds :) Please Note: results are normally superb, however the recording may not work if your placenta is at the front of the tummy or the baby is in the wrong position. **** Supported Phones **** 15, 14, 13,12, X, Xs, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6. We don't support iPad. **** Worried about safety? We are too! *** HMB is safe but to be extra sure DO switch your iPhone to airplane mode. This is a precaution and automatically stops all cellular transmissions. **** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? **** No - under no circumstances is HMB a substitute for medical support - if you don't get a result it doesn't mean anything is wrong :) Consult your doctor for any advice. We are NOT approved by the FDA. This is not a medical device and is not a medical baby heartbeat monitor. It is for FUN. Please do check our T&Cs before downloading.

            "appDescription": "Buku Medicine was created initially as Buku Haematology, written by a haematology registrar and consultant as an easy and quick reference for the initial investigation and management of common haematology problems. 'Buku' is the Chichewa word for book or reference. Chichewa is spoken in Malawi where our pathology project MPathE is running. We made it to answer the commonest questions that haematologists are asked, and through that, improve patient care, educate our users and hopefully remove some of the fear usually associated with haematology. It is for all grades of generalist and specialist doctors, specialist nurses, physician assistants and has links to key references and guidelines. Data collected from users shows that it can prevent a call to haematology completely for 21% of clinical queries, and start further investigations to expedite care for up to 60% more. This reduces the on-call burden on haematologists and improves patient care by improving clinician efficiency. See our website for testimonials of how it has helped users. This model has been really well received and continues to grow (over 22,000 active users, installed on clinician devices in two NHS trusts and ORCHA approved). We have now started to apply this model to other specialties and have added Renal, Endocrinology, Hepatology and Rheumatology content to the App. We will continue to expand this to other specialties over the coming months. The information included is concise to make it easy to use, and further reading should be undertaken to gain a full understanding of the topics covered. Common causes are listed by frequency from general medical literature and our clinical experience. Please consider taking a couple of minutes to give as little as \u00a31 as a thank you for our time contribution (>400 hours) and to keep the app running.

Whether as a Paramedic on scene or as a clinician in hospital, this app can assist in running structured and effective adult cardiac arrest scenarios. Developed by clinicians working in large inner city teaching hospitals, this app takes into consideration the most recent Resuscitation Council (UK) Guidelines 2021. It serves as an aide-memoire for basic tasks that can easily be overlooked in stressful scenarios. iArrest also incorporates a number of timers to assist with rhythm analysis, adrenaline timings and arrest documentation. It will remind the user via audible and visual cues about necessary interventions even if a clinician\u2019s phone is muted. iArrest has been programmed to prevent phones from going into sleep mode, in order to ensure continuous use throughout the arrest. iArrest will record the exact time an important event or an intervention has occurred and present the user with a detailed log of events. These logs can be copied to the clipboard and used for documentation and record keeping. iArrest is currently undergoing extensive testing in simulated and real world scenarios. We are continuously improving and expanding on iArrest\u2019s functionality. Disclaimer: iArrest can not replace sound knowledge in Advance Life Support and should not be used by non-ALS trained clinicians.

The initial settings for minute ventilation (tidal volume (VT) and respiratory rate (RR)) will be proposed. The VT will be determined according to the predicted body weight, the body temperature and the type of patient (medical or surgical). VT/RR combinations for different targets of VT (3 to 10 mL / kg PBW will be provided, settings from 6 to 8 mL/kg PBW will be preferred).

Minute ventilation and alveolar ventilation (minute ventilation - dead space ventilation) are calculated. The physiological dead space is calculated according to published formulas linked to the predicted body weight of the patients, the instrumental dead space (linked to the volumes of the endotracheal tubes, connections, heat and moisture exchangers) is calculated. The impact of reducing dead space on several parameters is calculated (gain in alveolar ventilation, gain in reduction in tidal volume (and associated reduction in plateau pressure),or respiratory rate with constant alveolar ventilation) - Different Calculators (P/F ratio from SpO2, PBW\u2026) -Links to several additional tools (Quick Reference Respiratory Care Card; O2 demand calculator, Recruitment to Inflation Ratio\u2026) In addition to the measurements of these different parameters, several educational texts are accessible in the application to understand what dead space is during mechanical ventilation, what is instrumental dead space, what is the impact of dead space in function of ventilation settings and possible gains. These calculations and descriptions concern ventilated adult patients, in the emergency room, intensive care units and in the operating room.

Limit caffeinated beverages and milk on the day of your donation, as they reduce iron absorption and can elevate your pulse. 9. Avoid alcohol the day before and the day of your donation to prevent dehydration. 10. Avoid foods high in saturated fats and cholesterol the night before your donation, as they can make the donation process longer. 11. Get a good night\u2019s rest before your donation to aid in quicker recovery. 12. Discontinue and avoid all tobacco products before donating, as they may increase your blood pressure and heart rate. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Getting started is easy: If you're already registered in Grifols DonorHub\u2122: Just download the app and log in!

            "appDescription": "Recommendations on Mechanical Ventilation parameters. Non-invasive estimation of PaO2/FiO2, severity of Acute Respiratory Failure (SOFA score). Caution! This app is intended for intensive care physicians. If you are NOT a physician and would like to use it anyway, please consult your physician before using this app or making any medical decisions. This app has endorsement for usage in the Russian Federation. Many doctors deal with the treatment of patients with varying degrees of acute respiratory failure (ARF). But the choice of the optimal method and, especially, the timely correction of the parameters of invasive and non-invasive mechanical lung ventilation often cause difficulties, especially for young doctors. Unfortunately, expensive ventilation machines, without their skillful use, are not a guarantee of an improvement in the mortality rate in ARF. This has been especially evident during the COVID-19 pandemic. In international clinical practice, it is customary to determine the degree of ARF by the oxygenation index (the ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2)). This indicator is also included in most \"severity of illness\" scoring systems (SOFA, APACHE II-III, etc.). However PaO2 estimation is only possible after collecting the arterial blood for laboratory monitoring of blood gases, making it costly and invasive. In 2020-2021 a multicenter research was carried out at five clinical hospitals in Volgograd, Russia, which included 1038 patients with acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome against the background of viral (COVID-19) and bacterial pneumonia. The goals of the research were firstly, to develop a non-invasive method for determining the oxygenation index (PaO2 / FiO2) based on oxygen saturation (SpO2), and secondly, to define general criteria for correcting the parameters of invasive and non-invasive mechanical ventilation. This application is based on the results of the research. The relationship between SpO2 and PaO2 index values was determined for various FiO2 and types of respiratory support. The app also implements the general principle of oxygen therapy - from less to more invasive. The app allows the user not only to choose the most effective method of respiratory support, but also timely learn about the need for its correction. Every clinician knows that the mortality rate in patients with ARF is greatly influenced by the validity of the beginning and end of Invasive Mechanical Ventilation treatment - and this app solves this problem. The educational effect of this app should also be noted. It will help doctors to quickly master and more competently use expensive ventilation machines, which, of course, will have a beneficial effect on the results of treatment of patients with ARF.

The IVUSAID App is a free educational mobile application which has been developed to teach medical professionals how to use intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) for PCI guidance based on the current guidelines using our extensive experience and large database of complex coronary cases. Despite the growing body of evidence for clinical benefits of IVUS-guided PCI, IVUS remains underutilized in much of the world including the United States. Challenges in image interpretation and education are among the barriers to widespread adoption of IVUS in everyday clinical practice. Mount Sinai Heart is a global leader within the field of interventional cardiology as well as mobile apps development. The myriad of cases and pathology which are seen in The Mount Sinai Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory make it the perfect center to educate medical professionals within this field. The Key Concepts section of IVUSAID describes principles of IVUS, image acquisition, and concepts of ultrasound behavior in various tissues. The Image Interpretation section of the app has dozens of representative cross-sectional images, videos, and descriptions of plaque types, stent apposition and expansion, artifacts, and more. A short video for each type of lesion or artifact and post-stent findings, in addition to an annotated representative cross section aims to overcome a major limitation of any article or book on IVUS which present a static image, since the actual IVUS pullback is dynamic. Twenty-one complex coronary cases demonstrate IVUS guidance in a variety of patient presentations and lesions including ACS, LM bifurcation, severely calcified lesions and calcified nodules, spontaneous coronary artery dissection, and malapposed stents as well as how IVUS was used to inform treatment decisions. An extensive quiz section helps deliver educational content in a more interactive format where answers are accompanied by detailed explanations and references. We hope that IVUSAID will help techs, fellows, and early-career physicians incorporate IVUS in their daily practice for stent sizing, post-stent optimization, and identification of appropriate treatment strategies. more",

Part 1: Cardiogenic Shock Working Group Shock Stage Calculator The first page of the app features the Cardiogenic Shock Working Group Shock Stage Calculator. This calculator utilizes the CSWG-SCAI shock stage classification system to determine the severity of cardiogenic shock. It provides an accurate assessment of the shock stage, along with the predicted mortality rate for each stage. Additionally, the calculator presents separate mortality predictions for myocardial infarction-related cardiogenic shock (MI-CS) and heart failure-related cardiogenic shock (HF-CS). Furthermore, it offers a predicted probability of stage escalation. Part 2: Invasive Hemodynamics Calculator The second page of the app houses the Invasive Hemodynamics Calculator. This powerful tool enables healthcare professionals to calculate various important parameters related to hemodynamics. With this calculator, users can determine parameters such as cardiac output using the Fick method, cardiac index, cardiac power output, cardiac power index, pulse pressure, aortic pulsatility index, systemic vascular resistance, mean pulmonary artery pressure, right atrial pressure/pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, pulmonary artery pulsatility index, right ventricular stroke work index, transpulmonary gradient, and diastolic pulmonary gradient. Additionally, the calculator generates a graph that plots left heart filling pressure (PCWP) and right heart filling pressure (CVP or RAP) to aid in the classification of parameters into categories such as \"LV congestion,\" \"RV congestion,\" \"Hypovolemic,\" and \"BiV Congestion.\" Part 3:Congestion Profile Tracking Plot left heart filling pressure (PCWP) and right heart filling pressure (CVP or RAP) to aid in the classification of parameters into categories such as \"LV congestion,\" \"RV congestion,\" \"Hypovolemic,\" and \"BiV Congestion.\" Plot points longitudinally to see trends over time. Part 4: CSWG-SCAI Shock Phenotype Calculator The final part of the app is the CSWG-SCAI Shock Phenotype Calculator. This calculator is designed to determine the shock phenotype based on specific characteristics and clinical indicators. It classifies the shock phenotype into three categories: phenotype I (non-congested), phenotype II (cardio-renal), and phenotype III (cardiometabolic). Additionally, the calculator provides a predicted in-hospital mortality rate for each phenotype, aiding clinicians in risk stratification and treatment planning. The CSWG App for iOS consolidates essential calculators and predictive capabilities in a user-friendly interface, offering a valuable resource for healthcare professionals involved in the management of cardiogenic shock. By facilitating accurate assessments, providing hemodynamic insights, and assisting in the determination of shock phenotypes, this app aims to optimize patient care and outcomes in the challenging context of cardiogenic shock. Please note that this app only presents data published in the literature and should not be a substitute for clinical decision making. The treating clinician/team should use their judgement and experience in clinical decision making. more",

A guide you wish you always had at your fingertips. About Valve in Valve app was originally developed as a collaboration between the technology company UBQO and Dr. Vinayak (Vinnie) Bapat, Consultant Cardiac Surgeon at St. Thomas' Hospital, London, UK. The team at KRUTSCH reimagined the app, introducing modern design, as well as a novel editing interface for to allow cardiologists to edit cloud-hosted valve data. Valve in Valve app provides information specific for a clinical scenario, quickly and simply. This will help in the planning of and performing a Valve in Valve case. The application navigates the user through important aspects of surgical and TAVR valve design, which are vital for a successful Valve in Valve procedure. The app logically steps through the possible combinations to give the user specific information needed to perform the procedure. Success of a Valve in Valve procedure is based on correct identification of the surgical valve, choosing the correct size of the TAVR valve and its subsequent accurate placement. Surgical valves vary in appearance under fluoroscopy and also in their internal diameter. Similarly TAVR valves differ in their appearances and available sizes. Knowledge about all the surgical valves that have been implanted in the last two decades is minimal but relevant to the Valve in Valve therapy. Users can now familiarise themselves with important design information about surgical and TAVI valves; they can also select the valve and find out which size of TAVR valve could be used and how it is best placed during a Valve in Valve procedure. If the valve type is unknown, the App also guides the user through a series of steps where they can identify the surgical valve type and then use the information available for it. The Valve In Valve app can be used to plan a case and confirm suitability for this procedure and reduces the need to trawl through vast amounts of literature to find information specific to the clinical scenario. The information is also available without the need for an internet connection and will enhance the users understanding of various aspects of this procedure. We hope this will result in improved results and better outcomes for patients. Key features - Design information for multiple types of surgical valve - Sizing information for multiple types of surgical valve - Real life and fluoroscopic images of all the surgical valves - Design information about TAVR valve designs - Sizing information for these TAVR valves - Guides the user through a stepped process to help choose a specific valve, then the size and lastly the important dimensions to plan a Valve in Valve procedure - Image based guidance for the ideal placement of a TAVR valve - Video examples of actual placement of a TAVR valve - Discusses important design considerations in detail to improve understanding of the Valve in Valve procedure more",
